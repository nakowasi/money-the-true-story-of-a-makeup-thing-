<h1 id="calibre_link-89" class="sect">Money Is Fiction 金钱钱是虚构的</h1>
<p class="noindent">In the fall of 2008, I went out to dinner with my aunt Janet. She started life as a poet (the ’60s) and wound up with an MBA (the ’80s), so she’s a good person to talk with about money. In the weeks before our dinner, trillions of dollars in wealth had suddenly vanished. I asked her where all that money went.</p>

<p class="noindent">2008 年秋天，我和我的姨妈珍妮特出去吃饭。她以诗人的身份开始生活（60 年代），最后获得了 MBA 学位（80 年代），所以她是一个可以和我谈论金钱的好人选。在我们晚餐前的几个星期，数万亿美元的财富突然消失了。我问她那些钱都去哪儿了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Money is fiction,” she said. “It was never there in the first place.” That was the moment I realized money is weirder and more interesting than I thought.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“钱是虚构的”，她说。它一开始就不存在。”那一刻，我意识到金钱比我想象的更古怪、更有趣。</p>

<p class="calibre9">I was working as a reporter at the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> at the time, but I covered health care and didn’t know much about finance or economics. As the financial world fell apart, I started looking for anything that would explain what was going on. I discovered a podcast called <em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em>. The hosts didn’t use dry, news-story language or voice-of-God anchorman tones. They talked like smart, funny people who were figuring out what was going on in the world and telling stories to explain it. I loved the show so much I went to work there.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时我在《华尔街日报》担任记者，但我报道医疗保健，对金融或经济不甚了解。随着金融世界的崩溃，我开始寻找任何可以解释发生了什么的东西。我发现了一个名为<em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em>的播客。主持人没有使用干巴巴的新闻故事语言或上帝之声的主播语调。他们的谈话就像聪明的、有趣的人，他们正在弄清楚世界上发生了什么，并讲故事来解释它。我非常喜欢这个节目，乃至于开始去那里工作。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the time I got to <em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em> , the acute phase of the financial collapse was over, and we started looking at less urgent but more fundamental subjects. In 2011, we went on the radio show <em class="calibre4">This American Life</em> to ask the question I’d been wrestling with since that dinner with my aunt: “What <em class="calibre4">is</em> money?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当我谈到<strong class="calibre4">Planet Money</em>时，金融崩溃的急性阶段已经过去，我们开始关注不那么紧迫但更基本的问题。2011 年，我们上了广播节目<em class="calibre4">This American Life</em>，提出了我在与姨妈吃饭后一直纠结的问题。“什么<em class="calibre4">是</strong>钱？”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The host, Ira Glass, called it “the most stoner question” he had ever posed on his show.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">主持人艾拉·格拉斯称这是他在节目中提出过的“最硬的问题”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Maybe! But if so, it’s the good kind of stoner question, the kind that still seems interesting in the sober light of morning. I returned to the idea of money again and again, chipping away little pieces, one episode at a time. Each little piece was interesting, but the more I learned, the more I felt like there was a deeper, richer story to tell. So I started working on this book.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">也许吧! 但如果是这样的话，这真是很好的硬问题，那种在清醒的晨光中仍然显得有趣的问题。我一次又一次地回到钱的概念上，一次又一次地削去一些小碎片，一次又一次地削去一小段。每个小片段都很有趣，但我了解得越多，就越觉得有一个更深刻、更丰富的故事要讲。所以我开始着手写这本书。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Over time, I came to understand what my aunt meant when she said money is fiction. Money feels cold and mathematical and outside the realm of fuzzy human relationships. It isn’t. Money is a made-up thing, a shared fiction. Money is fundamentally, unalterably social. The social part of money&mdash;the “shared” in “shared fiction”&mdash;is exactly what makes it money. Otherwise, it’s just a chunk of metal, or a piece of paper, or, in the case of most money today, just a number stored on a bank’s computers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着时间的推移，我开始理解我姑姑说金钱是虚构的意思。金钱给人的感觉是冰冷的、数学化的，在模糊的人际关系领域之外。其实不然。金钱是一种虚构的东西，是一种共享的虚构（shared fiction）。金钱从根本上说，它的社会性的不可改变。钱的社会性部分 —— “共享虚构”中的“共享” —— 正是使它成为钱的原因。否则，它只是一大块金属，或一张纸，或者，在今天大多数钱的情况下，只是一个存储在银行电脑上的数字。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Like fiction, money has changed profoundly over time, and not in a steady or gentle way. When you look back, you see long periods of relative stability, and then suddenly, in some corner of the world, money goes bananas. Some wild genius has a new idea, or the world changes in some fundamental way that demands a new kind of money, or a financial collapse causes the monetary version of an existential crisis. The outcome is a profound change in the basic idea of money&mdash;what it is, who gets to create it, what it’s supposed to do.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就像小说一样，货币（）随着时间的推移发生了深刻的变化，而且不是以一种稳定或温和的方式。当你回顾过去的时候，你会看到很长一段时间的相对稳定，然后突然间，在世界的某个角落，货币变得疯狂。一些疯狂的天才有一个新的想法，或者世界以某种根本的方式改变，需要一种新的货币，或者金融崩溃导致货币版本的生存危机。其结果是货币的基本概念发生了深刻的变化，它是什么，谁来创造它，它应该做什么。</p>

<p class="calibre9">What counts as money (and what doesn’t) is the result of choices we make, and those choices have a profound effect on who gets more stuff and who gets less, who gets to take risks when times are good, and who gets screwed when things go bad. Our choices about  money gave us the world we live in now: the world where, when a pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, central banks could create trillions of dollars and euros and yen out of thin air in an effort to fight an economic collapse. In the future we’ll make different choices, and money will change again.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">什么算作钱（什么不算）是我们所做选择的结果，而这些选择对谁得到更多的东西，谁得到更少的东西，谁在形势好的时候可以承担风险，谁在形势不好的时候被坑害，有着深远的影响。我们对金钱的选择给了我们现在生活的世界：在这个世界上，当 2020 年春天发生大流行病时，中央银行可以凭空创造出数万亿美元、欧元和日元，以努力对抗经济崩溃。在未来，我们会做出不同的选择，而货币将再次发生变化。</p>

<p class="calibre9">These origin stories of money are the best way I know to understand what money is, and the power it has, and what we fight about when we fight about money. This book is the story of the moments&mdash;full of surprise and delight and brilliance and insanity&mdash;that gave us money as we know it today.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这些关于金钱的起源故事是我所知道的理解什么是金钱、它所具有的力量以及当我们为金钱而争斗时我们所争斗的内容的最好方式。这本书讲述了那些充满惊奇、喜悦、辉煌和疯狂的时刻，这些时刻给了我们今天所知的金钱。</p>

<p class="noindent1">The origin of money isn’t what we thought it was; the story is more messy and bloody and interesting. Marriage and murder are part of it. So is the invention of writing.

<a href="#calibre_link-32">The Origin of Money 金钱的起源</a>
</h1>
<p class="noindent">Around 1860, a French singer named Mademoiselle Zélie went on a world tour with her brother and two other singers. At a stop at a small island in the South Pacific, where most people didn’t use money, the singers agreed to sell tickets in exchange for whatever goods the islanders could provide.</p>

<p class="noindent">大约在 1860 年，一位名叫泽利小姐（Mademoiselle Zélie）的法国歌手与她的哥哥和另外两位歌手一起进行世界巡回演出。在南太平洋的一个小岛上停留时，那里的大多数人都不使用钱，歌手们同意出售门票，以换取岛民们可以提供的任何物品。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The show was a hit. A local chief attended. They sold 816 tickets. Zélie sang five songs from popular operas of the day. In a letter to her aunt, Zélie catalogued her pay for the show: “3 pigs, 23 turkeys, 44 hens, 5000 coconuts, 1200 pineapples, 120 bushels of bananas, 120 pumpkins, 1500 oranges.” But the windfall, Zélie wrote, left her with a problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这场演出很受欢迎。一位地方酋长出席了会议。他们卖出了 816 张票。泽利演唱了当时流行的歌剧中的五首歌曲。在给她姑姑的信中，泽利记录了她为这次演出付出的代价。“3 头猪，23 只火鸡，44 只母鸡，5000 个椰子，1200 个菠萝，120 蒲式耳香蕉，120 个南瓜，1500 个橙子”。但是，泽利写道，这笔意外之财给她留下了一个问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“What to do with these proceeds?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“如何处理这些收益？” </p>

<p class="calibre9">If she were at the market in Paris, Zélie told her aunt, she could sell everything for 4,000 francs. A nice haul! “But here, how to resell this, how to cash in all this? The fact is that it is quite difficult to hope to find money from buyers who themselves have paid in pumpkins and coconuts for the pleasure of listening to us.…</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果她在巴黎的市场上，泽利告诉她的姨妈，她可以用 4000 法郎卖掉所有东西。一笔不错的收入！。“但在这里，如何转售这些东西，如何把这些东西变现？事实上，希望从买家那里找到钱是相当困难的，因为他们自己已经用南瓜和椰子来支付听我们唱歌……”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“I am told that a speculator from a nearby island… will arrive tomorrow to make cash offers to me and my comrades. In the  meantime, to keep our pigs alive, we feed them the pumpkins while the turkeys and chickens eat the bananas and oranges.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我被告知，一个来自附近岛屿的投机者…… 明天将抵达，向我和我的朋友们提出现金报价。同时，为了让我们的猪活着，我们给它们喂南瓜，而火鸡和鸡则吃香蕉和橙子。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1864, Zélie’s letter was published as a footnote in a French book on the history of money. The British economist William Jevons loved the footnote so much that a decade later he used it to open his own book, <em class="calibre4">Money and the Mechanism of Exchange</em>. The moral of the story, for Jevons: barter sucks.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1864 年，泽利的信作为脚注发表在一本关于货币历史的法国书中。英国经济学家威廉·杰文斯(William Jevons)非常喜欢这个脚注，以至于十年后他用它来开启自己的书，《货币和交易机制》。对杰文斯来说，这个故事的寓意是：易货贸易很糟糕。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The trouble with barter, Jevons said, was that it required a “double coincidence” of wants. Not only did the islanders have to want what Mademoiselle Zélie offered (a concert); Zélie had to want what the islanders offered (pigs, chickens, coconuts). Human societies solved that problem, Jevons said, by agreeing on some relatively durable, relatively scarce thing to use as a token of value. We solved the problem of barter by inventing money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">杰文斯说，以物易物的问题在于，它需要“双重巧合”的需求。岛民不仅要想要泽利小姐提供的东西（音乐会）；泽利也要想要岛民提供的东西（猪、鸡、椰子）。杰文斯说，人类社会通过商定一些相对耐用、相对稀缺的东西作为价值象征来解决这个问题。我们通过发明货币解决了易货贸易的问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Adam Smith had said the same thing a hundred years earlier, and Aristotle had said something similar a few thousand years before that. This theory&mdash;that money emerged from barter&mdash;is elegant and powerful and intuitive, but it suffers from one key weakness: there’s no evidence that it’s true. “No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money,” the anthropologist Caroline Humphrey wrote in 1985, summarizing what anthropologists and historians had been pointing out for decades.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">亚当·斯密在 100 年前也说过同样的话，亚里士多德在几千年前也说过类似的话。这个理论 —— 货币产生于易货贸易 —— 是优雅的、强大的和直观的，但它有一个关键的弱点：没有证据表明它是真的。人类学家卡罗琳·汉弗莱在 1985 年写道，他总结了人类学家和历史学家几十年来一直指出的问题：“从来没有描述过纯粹的易货经济的例子，更不用说货币的出现了。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The barter story reduces money to something cold and simple and objective: a tool for impersonal exchange. In fact, money is something much deeper and more complex.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">以物易物的故事将货币简化为冷酷、简单和客观的东西：一个非个人交换的工具。事实上，货币是一种更深刻、更复杂的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People in pre-money societies were largely self-sufficient. They killed or grew or found their food, and they made their own stuff. There was some trade, but often it was part of formal rituals with  strict norms of giving and getting. Money arose from these formal rituals at least as much as it did from barter.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">前货币社会的人们基本上是自给自足的。他们杀戮、种植或寻找他们的食物，并且他们自己制造东西。有一些贸易，但往往是正式仪式的一部分，有严格的给予和获取规范。货币产生于这些正式的仪式，至少和它产生于易货贸易一样多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the case of Mademoiselle Zélie, the local custom where she visited would have been to take the pigs and turkeys and coconuts and bananas, and throw a feast for everybody. This would have given her status&mdash;like the status people get today for paying for a new hospital wing or university library. The guests at the feast would likely have been obliged in turn to throw a feast for Zélie. Entire economies were built on this kind of reciprocity.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就泽利小姐而言，她所访问的地方的习俗是把猪、火鸡、椰子和香蕉拿出来，为大家举行宴会。这将给她带来地位，就像今天人们为新的医院侧翼或大学图书馆付款所得到的地位一样。宴会上的客人很可能会反过来为泽利举办宴会。整个经济都建立在这种互惠的基础上。</p>

<p class="calibre9">On the northwest coast of North America, for example, at festivals called potlatch, Native American people spent days hanging out, making speeches, dancing, and giving stuff to each other. Gift giving was a power move, like insisting on paying the check at a restaurant. Before the Europeans arrived, high-status people gave furs and canoes. By the twentieth century, they were giving sewing machines and motorcycles. This wanton generosity freaked out the Canadians so much that the government made the practice illegal. People went to prison for giving stuff to each other.</p>


<p class="calibre9 cn">例如，在北美的西北海岸，在被称为“锅碗瓢盆”（potlatch）的节日里，美国原住民花了好几天时间闲逛，发表演讲，跳舞，并互相赠送东西。送礼是一种权力行为，就像在餐馆里坚持买单一样。在欧洲人到来之前，地位高的人赠送毛皮和独木舟。到了二十世纪，他们开始赠送缝纫机和摩托车。这种肆意的慷慨让加拿大人感到非常害怕，以至于政府将这种做法定为非法。人们因为互相赠送东西而进了监狱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Lots of cultures had precise rules about what you had to give somebody if you wanted to marry their child, or if you had killed their spouse. In many places, you had to give cattle; in other places it was cowrie shells. In Fiji it was sperm whales’ teeth, and among Germanic tribes in Northern Europe it was rings made of gold, silver, or bronze. (Those tribes even had a specific word&mdash;<em class="calibre4">wergild</em> , “man payment”&mdash;for a payment to resolve a murder.) Rules for ritual sacrifice were often similarly explicit. In Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific, only certain pigs with especially big tusks could be sacrificed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">很多文化都有明确的规定，如果你想和某人的孩子结婚，或者你杀了他的配偶，你必须给他什么。在许多地方，你必须给牛；在其他地方，则是牛肚壳。在斐济是抹香鲸的牙齿，而在北欧的日耳曼部落中，是金、银或铜制的戒指。(这些部落甚至有一个特定的词 —— <em class="calibre4">wergild</em>，“男人的付款” —— 用于解决谋杀案的付款）。) 祭祀的规则往往也同样明确。在南太平洋的瓦努阿图群岛，只有某些獠牙特别大的猪可以被献祭。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Once you know that anybody who is going to get married needs a string of cowrie shells, or that everybody who is going to attend  the ritual sacrifice needs a long-tusked pig, you have an incentive to accumulate these things&mdash;even if you have no immediate need for them. Someone is going to need them soon enough. These objects become a way to store value over time. They are not quite money as we know it, but proto-money; they are money-adjacent. In Vanuatu, an elaborate web of borrowing and lending long-tusked pigs developed. Interest was based on the rate at which the tusks grew. An anthropologist reported that “a high proportion of the disputes and murders [were] over the payment or non-payment of pig debts.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一旦你知道任何一个要结婚的人都需要一串牛肝菌，或者每个要参加祭祀的人都需要一头长牙猪，你就有动力去积累这些东西 —— 即使你对它们没有直接的需求。很快就会有人需要它们。这些物品随着时间的推移成为一种储存价值的方式。它们不完全是我们所知的货币，而是原生货币；它们与货币相近。在瓦努阿图，形成了一个精心设计的长牙猪借贷网络。利息是根据猪牙的生长速度而定的。一位人类学家报告说，“很大部分的纠纷和谋杀都是因为支付或不支付猪的债务”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Money isn’t just some accounting device that makes exchange and saving more convenient. It’s a deep part of the social fabric, bound up with blood and lust. No wonder we get so worked up over it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">货币不仅仅是一些使交换和储蓄更方便的会计装置。它是社会结构的深层部分，与血液和欲望紧密相连。难怪我们会对它如此激动。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-95" class="sect1">IOU Six Sheep 我欠你六只羊</h1>

<p class="noindent">Gift giving and reciprocity worked great in small villages built around family relationships, but they were a tough way to run a city. And by the time the first known cities began to emerge in Mesopotamia more than 5,000 years ago, people had started sealing little clay tokens inside hollow clay balls to represent debts. A little cone stood for a measure of barley; a disc stood for a sheep. If I gave you a ball with six discs inside, it meant IOU six sheep. At some point, people started pressing the tokens into the outside of the ball before sealing them in, to indicate what was inside. Eventually, somebody realized they didn’t need to put the tokens inside the ball at all: they could just use the marking on the outside to represent the debt.</p>

<p class="noindent">送礼和互惠在围绕家庭关系建立的小村庄里非常有效，但对于管理一个城市来说却是一种艰难的方式。当 5000 多年前美索不达米亚开始出现第一批已知的城市时，人们已经开始在空心粘土球中封存小粘土令牌，以代表债务。一个小圆锥体代表一计量的大麦；一个圆盘代表一只羊。如果我给你一个里面有六个圆盘的球，就意味着欠下六只羊。在某些时候，人们开始在密封之前将代币压在球的外面，以表明里面是什么。最后，有人意识到他们根本不需要把代币放在球里面：他们可以直接用外面的标记来表示债务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As Mesopotamian cities grew, power was centralized in urban temples and jobs became more specialized. Keeping track of who  owed what to whom got more complicated. A class of people who worked for the temple (which functioned as a proto&ndash;city hall) figured out how to keep track of stuff by elaborating on the tokens-pressed-in-clay system. They used a reed stylus to make marks on a little clay tablet and started using abstract symbols for numbers themselves. The first writers weren’t poets; they were accountants.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着美索不达米亚城市的发展，权力被集中在城市的神庙中，工作变得更加专业化。追踪谁欠了谁的东西变得更加复杂。一类为神庙工作的人（神庙的功能是原始的市政厅）想出了一个办法，即通过对代币 —— 压在粘土上的系统进行详细的阐述来记录东西。他们用芦苇笔在小泥板上做记号，并开始使用抽象的符号来表示数字本身。第一批作家不是诗人，他们是会计。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For a long time, that’s all writing was. No love notes. No eulogies. No stories. Just IOU six sheep. Or, as a tablet from a famous mound in a Sumerian city called Uruk, in present-day Iraq, said: “Lu-Nanna, the head of the temple, received one cow and its two young suckling bull calves from the royal delivery from [a guy named] Abasaga.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有很长一段时间，这就是写作的全部。没有爱情笔记。没有悼词。没有故事。只有六只羊的欠条。或者，正如苏美尔人在现今伊拉克的一个叫乌鲁克的城市的著名土丘上的一块石碑所说：“神庙的负责人卢·南娜从（一个叫）阿巴萨加的人那里得到了一头母牛和它的两头小乳牛。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Silver&mdash;a metal people had used previously for jewelry and rituals&mdash;was desirable and scarce and easy to store and divide, and it became money-ish in Mesopotamia, but for lots of people&mdash;maybe most people&mdash;money still wasn’t a thing. They raised food and animals and ate what they grew. Once in a while, a tax collector who worked for the priest, or the queen, or the pharaoh, came around and took some of their barley and sheep. In some cities, the people who worked at the temple or palace also told the artisans who made cloth and bowls and jewelry what to make, and how much, then handed out the stuff as they saw fit.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银 —— 一种人们以前用于珠宝和仪式的金属 —— 是可取的、稀缺的、容易储存和分割的，它在美索不达米亚成了货币，但对很多人 —— 也许大多数人 —— 钱仍然不是个东西。他们饲养食物和动物，吃自己种的东西。偶尔，一个为牧师、女王或法老工作的收税员会过来，拿走他们的一些大麦和羊。在一些城市，在神庙或宫殿工作的人还告诉制造布匹、碗和珠宝的工匠应该制造什么，以及制造多少，然后按照他们认为合适的方式分发这些东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The more some central authority decides who makes what and who gets what, the less a society needs money. In the Americas, thousands of years after the Mesopotamians, the Incas would create a giant, complex civilization without any money at all. The divine emperor (and the government bureaucrats who worked for him) told people what to grow, what to hunt, and what to make. Then the government took what they produced and redistributed it. Incan accountants kept detailed ledgers in the form of precisely knotted  strings that recorded vast amounts of information. The Incas had rivers full of gold and mountains full of silver, and they used gold and silver for art and for worship. But they never invented money because it was a fiction they had no use for.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">越是由某个中央机构决定谁制造什么，谁得到什么，社会就越不需要钱。在美洲，美索不达米亚人之后数千年，印加人将在没有任何金钱的情况下创造一个巨大的、复杂的文明。神圣的皇帝（和为他工作的政府官僚）告诉人们种植什么，狩猎什么，以及制造什么。然后政府把他们生产的东西拿去重新分配。印加人的会计人员以精确打结的绳索形式保存详细的账簿，记录了大量的信息。印加人有满河的黄金和满山的白银，他们将黄金和白银用于艺术和祭祀。但他们从未发明过货币，因为那是对他们来说百无用处的一种虚构。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-98" class="sect1">Money Changes Everything 金钱改变一切</h1>

<p class="noindent">For a long time, the kingdoms in ancient Greece ran largely on this kind of tribute and redistribution, complete with accountants who kept track of everything in their own specialized script. But that civilization collapsed around 1100 <span class="small-caps">BC</span>. Nobody knows why&mdash;maybe there was an earthquake, maybe there was a drought, maybe pirate raiders swept in. The kings disappeared, the castles fell down, the population declined, and the bureaucrats’ accounting script was forgotten.</p>

 <p class="noindent">在很长一段时间里，古希腊的王国主要依靠这种进贡和再分配来运行，并有会计人员用他们自己的专门文字来记录一切。但是，这种文明在公元前 1100 年左右崩溃了。没有人知道原因，也许是地震，也许是干旱，也许是海盗袭击者扫荡。国王们消失了，城堡倒塌了，人口减少了，而官僚们的会计文字也被遗忘了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few centuries later, the Greek population started growing again. Villages became towns. A class of artisans emerged. Trade led to specialization: fancy pottery in Athens, metalwork in Samos, roof tiles in Corinth. In 776 <span class="small-caps">BC</span>, Greeks converged for the first time on a town called Olympia for a month of sporting events; the birth of the Olympics was a sign of closer ties among Greek towns, and of Greeks getting rich enough to take a month off and go hang out in Olympia.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几个世纪后，希腊人口又开始增长。村庄变成了城镇。一个工匠阶层出现了。贸易导致了专业化：雅典的花式陶器、萨摩斯的金属制品、科林斯的屋顶瓦片。公元前 776 年，希腊人第一次聚集在一个叫奥林匹亚的小镇上进行为期一个月的体育比赛；奥运会的诞生标志着希腊城镇之间的联系更加紧密，希腊人也变得足够富有，可以请一个月的假去奥林匹亚玩。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Greek towns started constructing public buildings and shared waterworks. It was the classic setting for an economy that revolved around a system of tribute and redistribution, controlled by a king or priest, which was still common in the civilizations to the east. But instead of creating top-down mini-kingdoms, the Greeks created something new. They called it the “polis,” a word whose standard  translation, “city-state,” is so boring and generic that you could almost overlook the fact that the polis is the origin of much of political and economic life in the West. Not coincidentally, it was also the place where the first thing we would recognize today as money really took off.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">希腊城镇开始建造公共建筑和共享水厂。这是一个典型的经济环境，围绕着由国王或牧师控制的进贡和再分配制度，这在东方的文明中仍然很常见。但希腊人没有建立自上而下的小型王国，而是创造了新的东西。他们称之为“polis”，这个词的标准翻译是“城邦”，它是如此无聊和通用，以至于你几乎可以忽略一个事实，即“polis”是西方许多政治和经济生活的起源。并非巧合的是，它也是我们今天最早认识到的货币真正起飞的地方。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hundreds of poleis developed around the Greek world, and each had a citizen assembly. In some, including Athens, the polis evolved into democracy (though, by our standards, it was a crappy democracy that excluded women, slaves, and most immigrants). In other poleis, the assembly would meet and argue, but final decisions would be made by a smaller elite.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在希腊世界中发展了数百个政体，每个政体都有一个公民大会。在包括雅典在内的一些地方，政体演变成了民主制度（尽管按照我们的标准，这是一种蹩脚的民主制度，将妇女、奴隶和大多数移民排除在外）。在其他的政体中，议会将举行会议并进行辩论，但最终的决定将由一个较小的精英做出。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in every case, the citizens&mdash;the polites&mdash;wanted a say in who gave what to whom. They needed a way to organize both public life and everyday exchange without a top-down, micromanaging ruler or a bottom-up web of kinship relations. They needed money!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在每一种情况下，公民 —— polites —— 都希望在谁给谁的问题上有发言权。他们需要一种方法来组织公共生活和日常交流，而不需要一个自上而下的微观管理的统治者或自下而上的亲属关系网。他们需要钱！</p>

<p class="calibre9">Around 600 <span class="small-caps">BC</span>, Greece’s neighbor Lydia, a kingdom in present-day Turkey, was mining a lot of a gold-silver alloy called electrum. This presented a kind of ancient first-world problem for the Lydians, because they had to assess the ratio of gold and silver in each piece to figure out its value. Somebody in Lydia came up with a clever solution: they started taking lumps of electrum with a consistent ratio of gold to silver, breaking them into standard sizes, and stamping the image of a lion onto each lump. So every lump of a given size had the same value as every other lump of that size. The Lydians had invented coins. Soon, they took the next step: they started minting coins of pure silver and pure gold.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大约在公元前 600 年，希腊的邻国吕底亚，一个位于今天土耳其的王国，正在大量开采一种叫做“洋銀”（Electrum）的金银合金。这给吕底亚人带来了一种古代第一世界的问题，因为他们必须评估每件物品中的金银比例来计算其价值。吕底亚有人想出了一个聪明的解决方案：他们开始取一些金银比例一致的洋銀，把它们分成标准尺寸，并在每块洋銀上印上狮子的图案。因此，每块给定尺寸的金属块与其它所有相同尺寸的金属块具有相同的价值。利迪亚人已经发明了硬币。不久，他们又迈出了下一步：他们开始铸造纯银和纯金的硬币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Greece might have flourished if coins didn’t exist. Coins probably would have spread even if Greece didn’t exist (for the story of coins in China, see the next chapter). But coins and Greece were a perfect match, and the Greeks went wild for coins.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果硬币不存在，希腊可能就会繁荣起来。即使希腊不存在，硬币也可能会传播（关于硬币在中国的故事，见下一章）。但硬币和希腊是完美的结合，希腊人为硬币而疯狂。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Standardized lumps of metal were exactly what the city-states needed to build their new kind of society&mdash;a society too big to run on familial reciprocity but too egalitarian to run on tribute&mdash;and soon there were a hundred different mints spread across Greece making silver coins. Within a few more decades, the money-ish things the Greeks had been using to measure value and exchange goods (iron cooking spits, lumps of silver) weren’t money-ish anymore. Money was coins, and coins were money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 标准化的金属块正是城邦建立他们的新型社会所需要的，这个社会太大，不能靠家庭互惠来运行，但又太平等，不能靠进贡来运行，而且很快就有一百个不同的铸币厂遍布希腊，制造银币。再过几十年，希腊人一直用来衡量价值和交换货物的类似于钱的东西（铁制炊具、银块）就不再像钱了。钱就是硬币，而硬币就是钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Coins transformed daily life in Greece. Each Greek city-state had a public space called the agora where citizens gathered to hear speeches and talk about the news and in some cases have formal meetings of the citizens. Around the time coins arrived, people started showing up at the agora with stuff to sell. Soon the agora became the market&mdash;this new kind of place where ordinary people went to buy and sell cloth and figs and pots and everything else. The agora also continued to be a place for public discussion, but in the long run shopping won out over public discourse. In modern Greek, the word <em class="calibre4">agora</em> is a noun that means market, and a verb that means to buy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">硬币改变了希腊的日常生活。每个希腊城邦都有一个被称为“广场”（agora）的公共空间，公民们聚集在那里听演讲，谈论新闻，在某些情况下还举行正式的公民会议。大约在硬币到来的时候，人们开始带着要卖的东西出现在广场。很快，广场变成了市场；这种新的地方，普通人在那里买卖布匹、无花果和锅子以及其他一切东西。广场也继续成为公共讨论的场所，但从长远来看，购物胜过了公共讨论。在现代希腊语中，“广场”这个词是一个名词，意思是市场，而动词则是指购买。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Before the arrival of coins, poor Greeks would work on the farms of rich landowners, but they didn’t get anything like a wage as we would understand it. They would agree to work for a season or a year, and the landowner would agree to give them food and clothes and a place to sleep. In the decades after coins arrived, that changed. Poor people became day laborers, showing up in the morning and getting paid at the end of the day. The practice of signing on to work for a year at a time vanished. Poor workers no longer had to stay on a farm for a year; they could leave if they were badly treated or if they found a better arrangement. But no one was  responsible anymore for feeding them and clothing them and giving them a place to stay. They were on their own.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在硬币出现之前，贫穷的希腊人会在富有的地主的农场里工作，但他们并没有得到任何我们所理解的工资。他们会同意工作一季或一年，而地主会同意给他们食物、衣服和睡觉的地方。在硬币到达后的几十年里，情况发生了变化。穷人成了日工，早上出现，在一天结束时得到报酬。签约工作一年的做法消失了。贫穷的工人不再必须在农场呆上一年；如果他们的待遇不好或找到更好的安排，他们可以离开。但是没有人再负责给他们提供食物和衣服，给他们一个住的地方。他们只能靠自己。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People flowed into the new wage-based economy. Women sold ribbons and picked grapes, though it was considered a sign of desperation when a citizen’s wife had to work for money. When the Athenians built a new temple on the Acropolis in the fifth century, slaves did a lot of the work, but wage laborers did some of the detail finishes, like carving the fluting into the columns at the front of the temple. Because a random accounting tablet happened to survive, we know that the slaves worked almost every day, but the wage laborers worked less than two-thirds of the time. Were the laborers choosing to take time off because they preferred to do something else? Or were they denied work that they needed to survive? As the scholar David Schaps asked, was it “the blessing of leisure or the curse of unemployment”?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们涌入新的基于工资的经济。妇女们卖丝带和摘葡萄，尽管当一个公民的妻子不得不为钱工作时，这被认为是一种绝望的表现。当雅典人在五世纪在雅典卫城建造一座新的神庙时，奴隶们做了很多工作，但雇佣劳动者做了一些细节上的修饰，比如在神庙前面的柱子上刻上凹槽。由于一块随机的会计碑文碰巧被保存下来，我们知道奴隶们几乎每天都在工作，但雇佣劳动者只有不到三分之二的时间在工作。劳动者选择休息是因为他们更愿意做其他事情吗？还是他们被剥夺了生存所需的工作？正如学者大卫·沙普斯（David Schaps）所问的那样，这是“休闲之福还是失业之祸？”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The spread of coins&mdash;the rise of money&mdash;made people more free and gave them more opportunities to leave the life they’d been born into. It also made people more isolated and vulnerable.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">硬币的传播 —— 货币的兴起 —— 使人们更加自由，给他们更多的机会离开他们出生时的生活。它也使人们更加孤立和脆弱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Not everybody liked what coins were doing to Greece. Aristotle complained about Greeks who thought of wealth as “only a quantity of coin,” and called getting rich in retail trade “unnatural.” Complaints like these would follow money forever, but they didn’t matter much in the end. Once coins took root in Greece, they took over the world.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">并不是所有人都喜欢硬币对希腊的影响。亚里士多德抱怨希腊人认为财富“只是硬币的数量”，并称通过零售贸易致富是“不自然的”。像这样的抱怨将永远跟随货币，但它们最终并不重要。一旦硬币在希腊扎根，它们就占领了全世界。</p>

</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 1271, Marco Polo went to Asia. Twenty-five years later, he went home to Venice, bought a ship to fight in a war against Genoa, got captured and thrown in jail, and dictated a book about his travels to his cellmate, a Pisan who was a writer of popular books, including the first Italian version of the story of King Arthur. Marco Polo’s book is important for lots of reasons, but for our purposes it’s huge because of chapter 24, which has the long-but-worth-it title: <em class="calibre4">How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money Over All His Country.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">1271 年，马可波罗去了亚洲。25 年后，他回到威尼斯，买了一艘船参加对热那亚的战争，被抓进监狱，并向狱友口述了一本关于他的旅行的书，这位皮萨人是一位流行书籍的作家，包括第一个意大利版本的亚瑟王的故事。马可·波罗的书之所以重要，有很多原因，但对我们来说，它的重要性在于第 24 章，这一章的标题很长，但值得一读：《伟大的卡安是如何将树皮做成像纸一样的东西，在他的国家里当作钱使用的》。<p

<p class="calibre9">Polo starts the chapter by saying: This is so crazy, you’re not going to believe me. (“For, tell it how I might, you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth and reason.”) He was right. His story about paper passing as money seemed so absurd to people in Europe that they thought he was making it up. (To be fair, they thought he was making a lot of stuff up, and some stuff he did make  up, but we know now that what Marco Polo said about money was true.) He saw in China a radical monetary experiment that appeared in the world for a moment, then disappeared and wouldn’t return anywhere on Earth for hundreds of years. What Polo saw reveals the fundamental economic miracle of an entire society starting to rise out of poverty&mdash;and how fleeting that miracle can be.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">波洛在这一章的开头说。这真是太疯狂了，你不会相信我。（“因为，无论我怎么说，你都不会满意我是在保持真理和理性。”）他是对的。他关于纸可以当钱用的故事在欧洲人看来是如此荒谬，以至于他们认为他在编造。（公平地说，他们认为他编造了很多东西，有些东西确实是他编造的，但我们现在知道，马可·波罗关于货币的说法是真实的。）他在中国看到了一个激进的货币实验，它在世界范围内出现了一会儿，然后就消失了，几百年来都不会再出现在地球上。马可波罗所看到的揭示了整个社会开始摆脱贫困的基本经济奇迹，以及这种奇迹是多么短暂。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For a long time before the age of Marco Polo (really, for all of the time before the age of Marco Polo), interaction between China and Europe was pretty limited. The Chinese invented coins around the same time the Lydians did, possibly earlier, but as far as anybody knows that was just a coincidence.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在马可波罗时代之前的很长一段时间里（真的，在马可波罗时代之前的所有时间里），中国和欧洲之间的互动相当有限。中国人发明硬币的时间与吕底亚人相同，可能更早，但据任何人所知，这只是一个巧合。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Some of the earliest Chinese coins were tiny knives and tiny shovels made out of bronze, which may have been a vestige of real knives and shovels serving as money-adjacent stuff. Eventually, coins turned into small pieces of bronze with a hole through the middle. The hole let people string a bunch of coins together to make it easier to carry them. This was useful because the value of coins was based on the value of metal they contained, and bronze wasn’t very valuable, so it took lots of bronze coins to buy stuff. The standard unit became a string of 1,000 coins, which weighed more than seven pounds.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">中国最早的一些钱币是用青铜制成的小刀和小铲子，这可能是真正的刀和铲子充当货币的遗留物。最后，钱币变成了中间有孔的小铜片。这个孔让人们把一串硬币串在一起，以便于携带它们。这很有用，因为硬币的价值是基于它们所包含的金属的价值，而青铜不是很有价值，所以需要很多青铜币来买东西。标准单位是一串 1000 枚硬币，重量超过 7 磅。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the early part of the first century <span class="small-caps">AD</span>, China had become a unified, bureaucratic empire. Tens of thousands of students took competitive exams to get high-status government jobs, and the lucky few who managed to land those jobs spent their working lives keeping extensive records written on silk and on tablets made of wood or bamboo. Treaties were written in triplicate: one copy for each side in the dispute, and a third for the spirits.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到公元一世纪初，中国已经成为一个统一的、官僚的帝国。数以万计的学生参加竞争性考试，以获得高地位的政府工作，而那些成功获得这些工作的幸运儿，在他们的工作生涯中，将大量的记录写在丝绸和木板或竹板上。条约都是一式三份：争端双方各执一份，第三份供神灵使用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As record keeping proliferated, the expense of silk and the  bulkiness of wood and bamboo became a problem: Chinese officials needed something better suited for all that paperwork. They needed paper. According to official records, they got it in 105 <span class="small-caps">AD</span>, when a eunuch named Cai Lun, the emperor’s “officer in charge of tools and weapons,” ground up mulberry bark, rags, and fish nets; dipped a screen into the mash; then let the mash dry on the screen. People loved paper, and Cai became rich and famous. (For a while, anyway. Eventually, Cai was accused of falsifying some financial paperwork, so he took a bath, put on his fanciest clothes, drank poison, and died.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着记录的增多，丝绸的昂贵和木头、竹子的笨重成为一个问题：中国官员需要一种更适合所有文书工作的东西。他们需要纸张。根据官方记录，他们在公元 105 年得到了这种东西，当时一个名叫蔡伦的太监，皇帝的“负责工具和武器的官员”，将桑树皮、破布和鱼网磨成泥，将丝网浸入泥中，然后让泥浆在丝网上干燥。人们喜欢上了纸，蔡伦也变得富有和出名。(无论如何，有一段时间。最后，蔡伦被指控伪造一些财务文件，所以他洗了个澡，穿上他最漂亮的衣服，喝了毒药，然后死了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Printing came a few hundred years later, driven in part by the spread of Buddhism, which prized reproducing sacred texts. Some monk who was tired of writing the same sacred text over and over and over had the truly brilliant idea of transferring the text to a wood block, carving away everything that was not the sacred text, then covering the block with ink and stamping it onto paper. The earliest surviving printed text is a paper scroll with a Buddhist prayer printed in China around 710 <span class="small-caps">AD</span>.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">印刷术出现在几百年后，部分原因是佛教的传播，佛教推崇复制神圣的文本。一些厌倦了一遍又一遍地书写相同的神圣文本的僧侣，想出了一个绝妙的主意：将文本转移到一个木块上，雕刻掉所有不是神圣文本的东西，然后用墨水覆盖木块，将其印在纸上。现存最早的印刷品是中国在公元 710 年左右印制的带有佛教祈祷文的纸卷</span></p>

<p class="calibre9">Now China had paper, and printing, and coins. The final step came two centuries later in the province of Sichuan. Most Chinese coins were made of bronze, but in Sichuan, where bronze was scarce, they used iron. In a world where the value of a coin was based largely on the value of the metal it was made of, iron was a terrible thing to use for money. To buy a pound of salt, you needed a pound and a half of iron coins. It would be like having to do all your shopping using only pennies.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">现在中国有了纸，有了印刷，有了钱币。最后一步是在两个世纪后的四川省。大多数中国硬币是用青铜制成的，但在四川，由于青铜匮乏，他们使用铁。在一个钱币的价值主要基于其制成的金属的价值的世界里，铁是一个可怕的东西，可以用来做钱。为了买一磅盐，你需要一磅半的铁币。这就像你现在只用一分硬币去购物一样地麻烦。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Around 995 <span class="small-caps">AD</span>, a merchant in Sichuan’s capital, Chengdu, had an idea. He started letting people leave their iron coins with him. In exchange for coins, he would give people fancy, standardized paper  receipts. The receipts were like coat-check tickets for coins. And just like anyone with a coat-check ticket can claim the coat, anyone with a receipt could claim the coins: the receipts were transferable. Pretty soon, rather than go to the trouble of getting their coins every time they wanted to make a purchase, people started using the coat-check receipts to buy stuff: the paper itself turned into money. (The merchant didn’t invent this out of thin air. Provincial governments had previously given traders paper receipts in exchange for bronze coins, but traders typically just used those receipts to avoid taking coins on long journeys; those receipts never really took off as money.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大约在公元 995 年<span class="small-caps"></span>，四川省会成都的一个商人有一个想法。他开始让人们把他们的铁币放在他那里。作为对硬币的交换，他将给人们花哨的、标准化的纸质收据。这些收据就像硬币的验衣票。就像任何有验衣票的人都可以领走外套一样，任何有收据的人都可以领走硬币：收据可以转让。很快，人们开始用验衣券来买东西，而不是每次想买东西时都麻烦地去拿硬币，纸张本身变成了钱。(商人并没有凭空发明这个东西。省政府以前曾给过商人纸质收据以换取铜币，但商人通常只是用这些收据来避免在长途旅行中携带铜币；这些收据从未真正作为货币出现过。）</p>

<p class="calibre9">Other merchants started issuing their own paper receipts. Inevitably, some shady merchant figured out that he didn’t need to start with a deposit of iron coins. He could just print up an IOU, go out in the world, and buy something with it. Once that happened, it was only a matter of time before someone came to trade in that IOU for iron coins and found out it was just a worthless piece of paper. People got angry. There were lawsuits. After a few years, the government took over the business of printing paper money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">其他商人开始发行自己的纸质收据。不可避免的是，一些黑心的商人发现他不需要从铁币的存款开始。他可以直接打印一张欠条，到外面的世界去，用它买东西。一旦发生这种情况，迟早会有人来用这张欠条换取铁币，却发现它只是一张毫无价值的纸。人们很生气。出现了诉讼。几年后，政府接管了印刷纸币的业务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For people who couldn’t read, most bills had a handy picture of the number of coins they could be exchanged for. There was usually some kind of landscape or streetscape. The bills were printed in multiple colors&mdash;text in black, landscape in blue, official seal in red. Almost always, a big chunk of the bill was taken up by a warning like this one, from a bill printed around 1100 <span class="small-caps">AD</span>:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">对于不识字的人来说，大多数钞票上都有一张方便的图片，显示它们可以兑换的硬币数量。通常有一些景观或街景。钞票以多种颜色印刷，文字为黑色，风景为蓝色，公章为红色。几乎所有的钞票都有一大块被警告字样所占据，如这张钞票是在公元 1100 年左右印制的：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">By imperial decree: criminals who counterfeit [this bill] are to be punished by beheading. The reward [for informers] shall be 1,000 <em class="calibre4">guan</em>.… If accomplices of counterfeiters or any who harbor them willingly identify the ringleaders to the authorities they will be absolved of criminal liability and given the above-stipulated reward.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">奉旨：伪造（本票）的罪犯将被处以斩首之刑。奖励（举报人）1,000 <strong class="calibre4">贯</strong>.... 如果造假者的同伙或任何包庇他们的人愿意向当局指认头目，他们将被免除刑事责任并得到上述规定的奖励。</p>
</div>

<p class="calibre9"> The warning wasn’t entirely successful: The earliest surviving printing plates for paper money are counterfeits. But despite the forgeries, paper money was a hit.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 这个警告并不完全成功。现存最早的纸币印版是伪造的。但是，尽管有这些伪造品，纸币还是受到了欢迎。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At a time when transporting large quantities of heavy coins made trade difficult or impossible, paper money was a breakthrough. As it spread across China, trade increased, people learned more from each other, and technology improved. Paper money even changed how people worked. For hundreds of years, taxes had been collected in cloth and grain, forcing people to weave and plant simply to meet the government’s demands. Now the government shifted toward collecting taxes in coins and paper. Suddenly, people were free (or freer, anyway) to choose what to do.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在当时，运输大量沉重的钱币使贸易变得困难或不可能，纸币是一个突破口。随着纸币在中国的传播，贸易增加了，人们相互学习的机会增多了，技术也提高了。纸币甚至改变了人们的工作方式。数百年来，税收一直是以布和粮食为单位，迫使人们仅仅为了满足政府的要求而进行编织和种植。现在，政府转而以硬币和纸币收税。突然间，人们可以自由（或者说更自由）地选择做什么。</p>

<p class="noindent">Scholars describe an “economic revolution” at this moment in China, hundreds of years before Europe’s own industrial revolution. Movable type and the magnetic compass were invented. Farmers figured out new agricultural techniques that allowed them to grow far more rice in the same amount of space. Printed books spread information on these breakthroughs around the country. More and more people moved out of a feudal(-ish) economy that ran on tribute, and into a market economy that ran on money. Now people could specialize in what they and their land were best suited for. Some grew mulberry trees, the leaves of which were fed to silkworms to make silk, and the bark of which was mashed into paper. Some grew seeds that were pressed into oils for “cooking, lighting, waterproofing, and to go in hair creams and medicines.” Some farmers started fish hatcheries; others built special containers to transport baby fish hundreds of miles to ponds best suited for raising the fish to maturity.</p>

<p class="noindent">学者们描述了此刻中国的一场“经济革命”，比欧洲自己的工业革命早了几百年。活字印刷术和磁罗盘被发明了。农民们发现了新的农业技术，使他们能够在相同的空间内种植更多的水稻。印刷的书籍将这些突破性的信息传播到全国各地。越来越多的人摆脱了依靠朝贡的封建经济，进入了依靠金钱的市场经济。现在，人们可以专门从事他们和他们的土地最适合的工作。有些人种植桑树，桑树的叶子被喂给蚕来制造丝绸，而桑树的树皮被捣碎成纸。有些人种植的种子被榨成油，用于“烹饪、照明、防水，以及制作发膏和药品”。一些农民建立了鱼苗孵化场；另一些人则建造了特殊的容器，将小鱼运到几百英里外最适合养鱼的池塘里，使其成熟。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Earlier emperors had confined markets to small, government-supervised blocks where prices were rigidly controlled. Merchants who tried to sell outside these markets were buried alive, a hundred at a time. Now, rules on markets were loosened, and people could sell what they wanted, where they wanted.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 早期的皇帝将市场限制在政府监管的小型街区，价格受到严格控制。试图在这些市场之外进行销售的商人被活埋，一次 100 人。现在，对市场的规定有所松动，人们可以在他们想要的地方出售他们想要的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Markets and money made cities. At a time when fewer than 100,000 people lived in London and Paris, two Chinese cities grew to more than a million people each. In Hangzhou, China’s southern capital, a restaurant scene appeared. Money now bought meals at cheap noodle shops, spicy Szechuan places, and fancy restaurants known for specialties like goose with apricots and noodles stuffed with pork. One account from the time suggests hip, urban diners were as insufferable then as they are now:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">市场和金钱造就了城市。在伦敦和巴黎的居民不到 10 万人的时候，中国的两个城市分别增长到 100 多万人。在中国南方的首都杭州，出现了一个餐馆的场景。现在有钱就可以在便宜的面馆、辛辣的四川菜馆以及以杏花鹅和猪肉馅面条等特色菜著称的高级餐厅吃饭。当时的一个说法是，时髦的城市食客当时和现在一样令人难以忍受：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">As soon as the customers have chosen where they will sit, they are asked what they want to have. The people… are very difficult to please. Hundreds of orders are given on all sides: this person wants something hot, another something cold, a third something tepid, a fourth something chilled; one wants cooked food, another raw, another chooses roast, another grill.…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">一旦顾客选择了他们要坐的地方，他们就会被问到他们想吃什么。这些人…… 是很难取悦的。四面八方都有数以百计的订单：这个人想吃热的，另一个人想吃冷的，第三个人想吃温的，第四个人想吃冷的；一个人想吃熟食，另一个人想吃生食，另一个人想吃烤肉……</p>

</div>

<p class="calibre9">The normal state of human affairs for most of human history was economic stasis: people, on average, did not become richer over time. In China, around the time paper money emerged, that changed. The money-driven growth of markets went hand in hand with technological breakthroughs, and as a result, a day’s work started to buy more stuff than it used to. People&mdash;not just a few people, but lots of people&mdash;were getting richer. This is the fundamental economic miracle, and it is the only way to sustainably raise the standard of living over the long run. (Not coincidentally,  intensive growth may also have emerged in ancient Greece around the time coins were invented, but it didn’t last.) By 1200, China was quite possibly the richest and certainly the most technologically advanced civilization in the world.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在人类历史的大部分时间里，人类事务的正常状态是经济停滞不前：平均而言，人们不会随着时间的推移而变得更加富有。在中国，大约在纸币出现的时候，情况发生了变化。货币驱动的市场增长与技术突破并驾齐驱，因此，一天的工作开始比过去买更多的东西。人们不仅仅是少数人，而是很多人都变得更加富有。这是基本的经济奇迹，也是长期可持续提高生活水平的唯一途径。(并非巧合的是，密集型增长也可能出现在古希腊，大约在硬币被发明的时候，但它并没有持续下去）到了 1200 年，中国很可能是世界上最富有的文明，当然也是技术最先进的文明。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then the Mongols rode in.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后蒙古人骑着马进来了。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-109" class="sect1">Money Backed by Nothing 钱无所依</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 1215, Genghis Khan’s army captured what is now Beijing. Forty-five years later, his grandson Kublai was elected Great Khan, and took control of the biggest empire in the world.</p>

<p class="noindent">1215 年，成吉思汗的军队占领了现在的北京。45 年后，他的孙子忽必烈被选为大汗，并控制了世界上最大的帝国。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The vast reach of the Mongol empire was great for trade. Now the market for Chinese goods extended not just throughout China, but across Asia and beyond. In cottage factories, Chinese artisans carved images of the Madonna and Child for export to Europe. An especially smooth type of Chinese silk also became popular in Europe. Shiploads of the stuff left from a Chinese port that Arab traders called Zaytun, which sounded to British ears like “satin,” so that’s what they called the fabric that came from there. The famous Moroccan scholar and traveler Ibn Battuta described Chinese trading ships that had four decks and carried a thousand people.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">蒙古帝国的广大范围对贸易来说是很好的。现在，中国商品的市场不仅扩展到整个中国，而且扩展到亚洲和其他地区。在家庭作坊里，中国工匠们雕刻着圣母和圣婴的形象，出口到欧洲。一种特别光滑的中国丝绸也在欧洲流行起来。一船船的丝绸从中国的一个港口出发，阿拉伯商人称之为“Zaytun”，在英国人听来就像“Satin”，所以他们就把来自那里的织物称为“缎子”。著名的摩洛哥学者和旅行家伊本·白图泰（Ibn Battuta）描述了中国的商船，它有四层甲板，可载一千人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Mongols were nomads, and they loved how much easier it was to move paper money than metal coins. They understood that speed meant wealth. So the year Kublai became the Great Khan, he created a new kind of paper money, to be used across vast swaths of the empire. He called it the “inaugural treasure exchange voucher.” (It’s not just paper; it’s a voucher you can exchange for treasure!) Kublai Khan really wanted people to use his new paper money, so he made it illegal to use bronze coins for trade. And as  Marco Polo saw when he arrived a few years later, the Great Khan’s plan worked.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">蒙古人是游牧民族，他们发现移动纸币比移动金属硬币容易得多。他们明白，速度意味着财富。因此，在忽必烈成为大汗的那一年，他创造了一种新的纸币，在帝国的广大地区使用。他称其为“首届宝物交换券”。(这不仅仅是纸，它是一张可以换取宝物的凭证！）忽必烈真的希望人们使用他的新纸币，所以他规定在贸易中使用铜币是非法的。正如马可波罗在几年后到达时看到的那样，大汗的计划是成功的。</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">This paper money is circulated in every part of the Great Khan’s dominions; nor dares any person, at the peril of his life, refuse to accept it in payment. All of his subjects receive it without hesitation, because, wherever their business may call them, they can dispose of it again in the purchase of merchandise they may require; such as pearls, jewels, gold, or silver. With it, in short, every article may be procured.… All of his Majesty’s armies are paid with this currency, which is to them of the same value as if it were gold or silver. Upon these grounds, it may certainly be affirmed that the Great Khan has a more extensive command of treasure than any other sovereign in the universe.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">这种纸币在大汗统治区的每一个地方都有流通；任何人都不敢冒着生命危险拒绝接受这种纸币付款。他的所有臣民都毫不犹豫地接受它，因为无论他们在哪里做生意，他们都可以用它来购买他们可能需要的商品，如珍珠、珠宝、黄金或白银。简而言之，用它可以买到任何物品....，国王陛下的所有军队都是用这种货币支付的，对他们来说，这种货币的价值与黄金或白银相同。基于这些理由，可以肯定的是，大汗比宇宙中任何其他君主都拥有更广泛的财富。</p>

</div>

<p class="calibre9">Being able to literally print money is awesome (it’s good to be the Khan), but with great power comes a great desire to print more and more. Kublai Khan resisted for a while, but eventually the temptation was too strong to bear. After all, Japan was sitting right there, across a little sea, just begging to be invaded. Why not print up a little more paper so we can pay people to build ships to sail 70,000 soldiers and horses over there to show them who’s universal sovereign?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">能够从字面上印钱是很了不起的（做大汗是件好事），但巨大的权力带来了印制越来越多的欲望。忽必烈大汗抵制了一段时间，但最终诱惑力太强，无法承受。毕竟，日本就在那里，隔着一个小海面，正等待着被入侵。为什么不多印一点纸，这样我们就可以花钱雇人造船，把 7 万名士兵和马匹开过去，向他们展示谁是普世的主权者？</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1287, after not one but two failed invasions of Japan, Kublai Khan issued a new kind of paper money. The paper still had pictures of bronze coins on it, but this time they were just pictures. Government offices refused to redeem the paper for silver or bronze; people could no longer exchange their treasure exchange vouchers for treasure. We have to imagine there was some panic. There was inflation: prices rose as money became less valuable. But then the economy stabilized. The center held. Pieces of paper that were just  paper, that weren’t even pretending to be treasure vouchers or silver IOUs, still worked as money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1287 年，在对日本的入侵不是一次而是两次失败之后，忽必烈汗发行了一种新的纸币。这张纸上仍然有铜钱的图片，但这次只是图片。政府办公室拒绝将纸币兑换成银币或铜币；人们无法再将他们的宝物兑换券兑换成宝物。我们不得不想象当时有一些恐慌。出现了通货膨胀：由于货币变得不那么值钱，价格上涨。但后来经济稳定下来。中心保持着。那些只是纸片，甚至没有假装成宝藏兑换券或银质欠条的纸片，仍然可以作为货币使用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the radical experiment that Marco Polo witnessed: money as almost pure abstraction, backed by nothing. It would be like if Wile E. Coyote ran off the cliff, looked down, saw empty space below him&mdash;and didn’t fall. Partly this is a testament to the sheer power of the Mongol state: use this paper as money or I’ll kill you. But partly, after three hundred years of using paper money, people in China had figured out that paper money worked not because it was backed by silver or bronze, but because everybody agreed paper could be money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这就是马可波罗见证的激进实验：货币几乎是纯粹的抽象概念，没有任何支持。这就像动画片里的大灰狼（Wile E. Coyote）跑下悬崖，往下看，看到下面是空的 —— 而没有掉下去。这在一定程度上证明了蒙古国的强大实力：把这张纸当钱用，否则我就杀了你。但部分原因是，在使用了三百年的纸币之后，中国人已经明白，纸币之所以有效，不是因为它有白银或青铜的支持，而是因为大家都认为纸可以成为货币。</p>

<p class="noindent">The era we live in now bears a bit of resemblance to China 1,000 years ago. Because of technological change, most people are richer than their ancestors were. This started in England about 250 years ago, with the industrial revolution. One of the oldest questions in economic history is: Why then and there? After thousands of years of economic and technological muddling along, what changed in England around 1800? Some people cite intellectual and legal changes like the scientific revolution and clearly defined property rights. Others take a more practical approach, arguing that the relatively high wages of British workers inspired people to create labor-saving machines, and that Britain just happened to have vast quantities of coal on hand to power those machines.</p>

<p class="noindent">我们现在所处的时代与 1000 年前的中国有几分相似。由于技术变革，大多数人都比他们的祖先更富有。这始于大约 250 年前的英国，随着工业革命的到来。经济史上最古老的问题之一是。为什么在那时和那里？在几千年的经济和技术混战之后，英国在 1800 年左右发生了什么变化？一些人引用了知识和法律的变化，如科学革命和明确界定的产权。另一些人则采取了更实际的方法，认为英国工人相对较高的工资激发了人们创造省力的机器，而英国恰好拥有大量的煤炭来驱动这些机器。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in the past few decades, as Western economists have become less Eurocentric, they’ve noticed that technological improvements and economic growth didn’t start two hundred years ago in England. China had its own economic revolution eight hundred years before England’s. And while economic growth didn’t explode in China the way it would in Europe, Chinese inventions from that era&mdash;paper,  printing, the magnetic compass&mdash;were essential for Europe’s development. Now, scholars are asking a new question: What happened to China? It was on the cutting edge of economic sophistication and new technology in 1300, but far behind by 1900. Why?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在过去的几十年里，随着西方经济学家变得不再以欧洲为中心，他们注意到技术改进和经济增长并不是从两百年前的英国开始。中国比英国早八百年就有了自己的经济革命。虽然经济增长没有像欧洲那样在中国爆发，但那个时代的中国发明，如纸张、印刷、磁罗盘，对欧洲的发展至关重要。现在，学者们正在提出一个新的问题。中国怎么了？在 1300 年，它还处于经济先进性和新技术的前沿，但到了 1900 年却远远落后。为什么？</p>

<p class="calibre9">Maybe it’s because China, as the dominant state in the region, wasn’t constantly pushing to economically outcompete its neighbors, so it stagnated relative to the European states that were always at war with each other. Maybe it’s because labor in China was cheap, so there was little incentive to continually invent labor-saving devices. Another reason is particularly compelling for our story: the Chinese rebel leader who drove out the Mongols really didn’t like money or markets.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">也许是因为中国作为该地区的主导国家，并没有不断推动在经济上超越其邻国，所以相对于那些总是在相互战争的欧洲国家来说，它停滞不前。也许这是因为中国的劳动力很便宜，所以没有什么动力去不断发明节省劳动力的设备。另一个原因对我们的故事特别有说服力：“赶走蒙古人的中国反叛领袖真的不喜欢钱或市场。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The man who became known as the Hongwu emperor was the child of poor farmers who died by the time he was sixteen. He entered a Buddhist monastery to avoid starving to death, then joined a band of anti-Mongol rebels and fought his way up through the ranks. In 1368, after the Mongols were pushed north of the Great Wall, Hongwu founded the Ming Dynasty, which would last for nearly three hundred years.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这个被称为洪武皇帝的人是贫苦农民的孩子，在他 16 岁的时候就去世了。为了避免饿死，他进入了佛教寺院，然后加入了一支反蒙古叛军的队伍，并在队伍中奋勇前进。1368 年，在蒙古人被赶到长城以北后，洪武建立了明朝，这个王朝将持续近三百年的时间。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hongwu wanted to take China back to a (totally idealized) past, a time not just before the Mongol invasion, but before China’s economic revolution. He dreamed of a nation of self-sufficient agricultural villages where people grew and shared what they needed. So he and his successors systematically got rid of the economic changes that drove China’s economic revolution. They banned overseas trading. They moved away from a money-and-markets economy back toward an ancient system of tribute and redistribution, in which the government took cloth and grain from peasants and gave it to government workers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">洪武想把中国带回一个（完全理想化的）过去，一个不仅在蒙古人入侵之前，而且在中国的经济革命之前的时代。他梦想建立一个由自给自足的农业村落组成的国家，在那里人们种植并分享他们所需要的东西。因此，他和他的继任者系统地摆脱了推动中国经济革命的经济变化。他们禁止了海外贸易。他们摆脱了货币和市场经济，回到了古代的朝贡和再分配制度，即政府从农民手中夺取布匹和粮食，并将其送给政府工作人员。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the mid-1400s, paper money had disappeared from China  entirely. People used lumps of silver as money, and sometimes copper coins, and often no money at all. The emperor had succeeded in dragging China back to the past. The average person in China was poorer than her ancestors had been two hundred years earlier. The economic revolution that happened when paper money was invented was largely forgotten.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到了十四世纪中期，纸币已经完全从中国消失了。人们用银块当钱，有时用铜钱，而且常常根本没有钱。皇帝成功地将中国拖回了过去。中国的普通人比她的祖先在两百年前更加贫穷。发明纸币时发生的经济革命在很大程度上被遗忘了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Because it happened a thousand years ago, China’s golden economic age of technological breakthroughs and paper money and fancy restaurants feels like a blip. And on a very long time horizon, it was dwarfed by the technological and economic growth of the past few centuries.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因为它发生在一千年前，中国的技术突破、纸币和高级餐厅的黄金经济时代感觉像是一个小插曲。而在很长的时间范围内，它与过去几个世纪的技术和经济增长相比相形见绌。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But there’s another way of looking at this blip: It lasted about as long as our current experiment with paper money and technological breakthroughs and fancy restaurants has lasted so far.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但也有另一种方式来看待这个小插曲。它所持续的时间与我们目前对纸币、技术突破和高级餐厅的试验迄今为止所持续的时间一样长。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Today, we take economic growth and scientific discoveries for granted. If the economy shrinks even a little bit, for a few seasons in a row, we declare it a recession and wonder what the problem is and when it will get better. But one thing China’s three-hundred-year-blip tells us is this: economic growth and technological change aren’t guaranteed to continue forever. Development is not a one-way street. Civilizations don’t just get richer or stay the same. Sometimes they become poorer, generation after generation. Sometimes money itself disappears.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">今天，我们把经济增长和科学发现视为理所当然。如果经济萎缩，哪怕是一点点，连续几个季度，我们就宣布这是经济衰退，并想知道问题出在哪里，什么时候会好起来。但是，中国三百年的昙花一现告诉我们一件事：经济增长和技术变革不能保证永远持续下去。发展不是一条单行道。文明并不只是变得更富有或保持不变。有时他们会变得更穷，一代又一代。有时，金钱本身也会消失。</p>

<p class="noindent">In seventeenth-century England, money was a mess.</p>

<p class="noindent">在十七世纪的英国，钱这个东西干脆是一团糟。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Ever since coins were invented, people had tried to steal a little metal out of them by clipping them along the edges or by putting them in a bag and shaking them to get a little silver or gold dust to fall off. Responsible governments would regularly mint new coins (the way modern governments replace torn bills with new ones) to freshen up the supply.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">自从硬币被发明以来，人们就试图从硬币中偷出一点金属，方法是沿着边缘剪断，或者把它们放在袋子里摇晃，让它们掉下一点银粉或金粉。负责任的政府会定期铸造新的硬币（就像现代政府用新的钞票替换破损的钞票一样）以更新供应。</p>

<p class="calibre9">England in the 1600s did not have a responsible government, and by the second half of the century, it was common for silver coins to contain much less silver than they were supposed to. Every time somebody had to pay somebody else, buyer and seller had to decide: Is this coin worth what it’s supposed to be worth, or is it worth less because there’s not enough silver in it?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">十六世纪的英国没有一个负责任的政府，到了本世纪下半叶，银币的含银量远远低于它们应该有的含银量是很常见的。每当有人要付给别人钱时，买方和卖方都必须作出决定。这枚银币的价值是它应该有的价值，还是因为里面的银子不够多，所以它的价值更低？</p>

<p class="calibre9">Workers and employers argued over pay. Fistfights broke out at markets. “Nothing could be purchased without a dispute,” the historian Thomas Macaulay wrote later. “Over every counter there was  a wrangling from morning to night.” Contracts started to stipulate not just how much money was to be paid, but the total weight of the coins in a payment. History ran in reverse. Coins became less like money and more like lumps of precious metal.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">工人和雇主为工资而争吵。市场上发生了拳脚相加的情况。历史学家托马斯·麦考利（Thomas Macaulay）后来写道：“没有纠纷，就买不到东西。”在每个柜台上，从早到晚都有争吵。合同开始规定，不仅要支付多少钱，还要规定付款中硬币的总重量。历史倒流了。硬币变得不再像钱，而更像贵重的金属块。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A second problem made things even worse. Because of international price differences, people could profit by taking full-weight silver coins out of England and trading them for gold in Paris or Amsterdam. As a result, even when the British mint did make good new silver coins, people almost immediately took those coins out of circulation to go trade them for gold in another country.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二个问题使事情变得更加糟糕。由于国际价格差异，人们可以通过将全重银币带出英国，在巴黎或阿姆斯特丹交易黄金而获利。因此，即使英国铸币厂真的制造出了好的新银币，人们也几乎立即将这些银币从流通中取出，去另一个国家换取黄金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So the British never had enough silver coins, and the silver coins they did have were terrible coins that nobody trusted. England needed more money. Not more wealth, just more tokens so people could buy and sell stuff.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，英国人从来没有足够的银币，而他们所拥有的银币也是无人信任的糟糕硬币。英国需要更多的钱。不是更多的财富，只是更多的代币，以便人们能够买卖东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, without really meaning to, goldsmiths started to solve the not-enough-money problem. Also without really meaning to, they created a new kind of problem that’s still with us today.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">后来，金匠们在没有真正意义的情况下，开始解决钱不够用的问题。同样，在没有真正意义的情况下，他们创造了一种新的问题，这种问题至今仍在我们身边。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Rich people sometimes stored their gold and silver in the vaults of local goldsmiths. Goldsmiths gave people receipts&mdash;just like that merchant in Sichuan had done hundreds of years earlier. In time, people started using the receipts themselves to buy and sell stuff. But this was just a substitution of paper for metal; it wasn’t adding more money to the world. The next step was the big one, the leap that not only links seventeenth-century goldsmiths with modern banks, but also explains why modern banks are both so essential and so dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">富人有时会把他们的黄金和白银存放在当地金匠的金库里。金匠给人们提供收据，就像几百年前四川的那个商人那样。随着时间的推移，人们开始使用这些收据来购买和出售东西。但这只是用纸代替了金属；它并没有为世界增加更多的货币。下一步是重要的一步，这一飞跃不仅将十七世纪的金匠与现代银行联系在一起，而且还解释了为什么现代银行既如此重要又如此危险。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Goldsmiths started giving people loans. No longer did you have to actually give the goldsmith your gold to get a claim check. You could just give him a promise to pay him back, with interest. In exchange for your promise, he would give you some of those claim  checks that were circulating as money. Then you could walk out into the streets of London and use the paper to start buying stuff. Suddenly, there was more money circulating in London than there used to be&mdash;the goldsmith had created money out of thin air. The goldsmiths were solving the not-enough-money problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">金匠们开始给人们提供贷款。你不再需要真的把你的黄金交给金匠，以获得一张索赔支票。你可以只给他一个承诺，让他连本带利地还钱。作为对你承诺的交换，他将给你一些作为货币流通的索赔支票。然后你可以走到伦敦的大街上，用这些纸开始买东西。突然间，在伦敦流通的钱比以前多了，金匠凭空创造了钱。金匠们解决了钱不够用的问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Right around the same time, something similar happened in Sweden, where people were especially eager to try paper money. The Swedes had a lot of copper, and they used copper for their coins. Copper wasn’t very valuable, so the coins were very big. Coin isn’t even really the right word: the largest denomination of Swedish money, worth 10 dalers, was two feet long and weighed forty-three pounds. People carried them strapped to their backs. So the Swedes created a bank that gave people paper money in exchange for giant copper coins. Like the goldsmiths in England, the Swedish bank almost immediately also started giving people paper money as loans. It was just so hard to resist; the paper money was just sitting there.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就在同一时间，类似的事情发生在瑞典，那里的人们特别渴望尝试纸币。瑞典人有大量的铜，他们用铜做硬币。铜不是很值钱，所以硬币非常大。硬币甚至不是一个真正正确的词：最大面额的瑞典钱，价值 10 达勒，有两英尺长，重达 43 磅。人们把它们绑在背上。因此，瑞典人创建了一家银行，给人们提供纸币以换取巨大的铜币。像英国的金匠一样，瑞典银行几乎立即也开始给人们提供纸币作为贷款。这实在是太难抗拒了，纸币就在那里摆着。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Banks today do what the British goldsmiths did almost four hundred years ago: when you deposit money, the bank turns around and lends some of it out to someone else. That money&mdash;your money&mdash;is now in two places at once. It is your money, in your account at the bank. It is also the borrower’s money. The borrower can deposit her money at another bank, which can then lend some of it out to yet another borrower. The same dollar is now in three places at once. This is called fractional-reserve banking, and it’s how the vast majority of money in the world is created.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">今天的银行所做的事情与近四百年前英国金匠所做的一样：当你存钱时，银行会转身将其中一部分借给其他人。这些钱 —— 你的钱 —— 现在同时在两个地方。它是你的钱，在你在银行的账户里。它也是借款人的钱。借款人可以将她的钱存入另一家银行，然后该银行可以将其中的一部分借给另一个借款人。同一块钱现在同时出现在三个地方。这就是所谓的部分准备金银行业务，世界上绝大多数的钱都是这样产生的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This feels spooky, and for good reason. Even as the goldsmiths were transforming British banking forever and starting to solve the not-enough-money problem, they were creating a new problem. The goldsmiths were giving out more gold claim checks than they had gold. If everybody with a claim check came back at the same  time and demanded their gold, the goldsmiths (and the people who wanted their gold back) would be screwed. Today, when everybody with money in the bank comes and asks for it at the same time, we call it a bank run. And the banks and the people who want their money back&mdash;which is to say, basically, everybody&mdash;are still screwed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这感觉很诡异，而且有充分的理由。即使在金匠们永远地改变了英国的银行业，并开始解决货币不足的问题时，他们也在制造一个新的问题。金匠们发放的黄金索赔支票比他们拥有的黄金还要多。如果每个持有认领支票的人都同时回来并要求得到他们的黄金，那么金匠（和那些想要回他们的黄金的人）就会被搞垮。今天，当每个在银行里有钱的人同时来要钱的时候，我们称之为“银行挤兑”。而银行和想要回自己的钱的人 —— 也就是说，基本上每个人 —— 还是被坑了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">While paper money was new to Europe, banking and bank runs were not. In Venice, money changers had started storing gold for people in the fourteenth century&mdash;and lending that gold out to other people. The money changers sat on benches on a busy bridge over the Grand Canal, so they were called <em class="calibre4">banchieri</em> , which translates as “bench-sitters,” and which is the root of our words <em class="calibre4">banker</em> and <em class="calibre4">bank</em>. To reduce the risk of bank runs, the Venetians required the bench-sitters to keep a certain percentage of gold in reserve. Barcelona had a more aggressive regulatory regime: bankers who couldn’t pay back depositors had to live on bread and water, and in 1360 one bankrupt Barcelona banker was beheaded in front of his bench.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">虽然纸币对欧洲来说是新事物，但银行和银行挤兑却不是。在威尼斯，货币兑换商在十四世纪就开始为人们储存黄金，并将这些黄金借给其他人。货币兑换商坐在大运河上一座繁忙的桥上，所以他们被称为<em class="calibre4">banchieri</em>，翻译成 “坐凳子的人”，也是我们的“<em class="calibre4">banker</em>” 和“<em class="calibre4">bank</em>”的词根。为了减少银行挤兑的风险，威尼斯人要求坐庄者保持一定比例的黄金储备。巴塞罗那有一个更积极的监管制度：无法偿还储户的银行家必须只靠面包和水生活，1360 年，一位破产的巴塞罗那银行家在他的长椅前被斩首。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bank runs came to London right after the goldsmiths turned into bankers. The goldsmiths had loaned a lot of gold to King Charles, and in 1672, Charles needed money to wage war against the Dutch, so he decided to stop paying the goldsmiths back. (It’s good to be the king.) People in London looked at those pieces of paper the goldsmiths had given them&mdash;the claim checks&mdash;and got nervous. Everybody went to their goldsmiths and asked for the gold back, and, of course, there wasn’t enough gold. Some goldsmiths went bankrupt. A few were imprisoned for debt. At least one fled the country. Suddenly, those goldsmith notes didn’t seem so much like money anymore. Just two weeks after the king stopped paying his bills, the treasurer of the navy worried that he had “taken notes which is now not money.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在金匠变成银行家之后，银行挤兑就来到了伦敦。金匠们借给了查尔斯国王借很多黄金，1672 年，查尔斯需要钱来对荷兰人发动战争，所以他决定停止向金匠们还钱。（当国王真好。）伦敦的人们看着金匠们给他们的那些纸片 —— 索赔支票 —— 感到很紧张。每个人都去找他们的金匠，要求把黄金拿回来，当然，黄金不够用了。一些金匠破产了。少数人因债务而被关进监狱。至少有一个逃离了国家。突然间，那些金匠的钞票看起来不再那么像钱了。就在国王停止支付账单的两个星期后，海军的财务主管担心他“拿到的是现在不是钱的钞票。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The thing that makes money <em class="calibre4">money</em> is trust&mdash;when we trust that we will be able to buy stuff with this piece of paper, or this lump of metal, tomorrow, and next month, and next year. One of the perpetual questions that still hovers over money is: Who can we trust? The British had tried trusting the government, but government-minted coins weren’t doing the job. So they turned to goldsmiths, and that didn’t work out so well. It would take another generation before they finally found something that worked: a solution that was neither purely private nor purely public, but a combination of the two, with the interests of the government and the interests of bankers and the interests of the people all pushing against each other.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">让金钱能够成为<strong class="calibre4">金钱</strong>的东西是信任 —— 当我们相信明天、下个月和明年我们将能够用这张纸或这块金属买到东西。笼罩在金钱上的一个永恒的问题是：我们能信任谁？我们能相信谁？英国人曾试图信任政府，但政府铸造的硬币并没有起到应有的作用。于是他们转向了金匠，但效果并不理想。又过了一代人的时间，他们终于找到了可行的办法：一种既不纯粹是私人的，也不纯粹是公共的，而是两者结合的解决方案，政府的利益、银行家的利益和人民的利益都在相互推诿。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-120" class="sect1">John Law’s First Act 约翰·劳的首次行动</h1>
<p class="noindent">John Law was born, almost too perfectly, upstairs from a goldsmith’s shop in Edinburgh. The goldsmith was his father, and the year was 1671, just before the run on the goldsmith bankers in London.</p>

<p class="noindent">约翰·劳恰巧出生在爱丁堡一家金匠铺的楼上，这几乎是太完美了。这位金匠是他的父亲，那一年是 1671 年，就在伦敦的金匠银行家们被赶走之前。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As John grew up, his dad grew rich. When John was twelve, his father bought a little castle outside of Edinburgh. Around the same time, Law went off to boarding school, where he excelled in math and a subject called “manly pursuits,” which, somewhat disappointingly, mostly means he was good at tennis.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着约翰的成长，他的父亲越来越富有。当约翰 12 岁时，他的父亲在爱丁堡外买了一座小城堡。大约在同一时间，罗去了寄宿学校，在那里他擅长数学和一个叫做“男子汉的追求”的科目，有点令人失望的是，这主要意味着他擅长网球。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law finished school, moved to London, chased women, bought clothes he couldn’t afford, and started gambling all the time. He was known in the parlance of the time as a beau, which rhymes with bro, and is kind of similar but more highbrow. Law’s father died, and John gambled away his inheritance and had to sell the castle to  pay his debts. In classic bro fashion, he was bailed out by his mom, who had her own inheritance, and bought the castle from him to keep it in the family and to keep Law out of debtors’ prison.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳完成了学业，搬到了伦敦，追逐女人，买他买不起的衣服，并开始一直赌博。在当时的说法中，他被称为“大哥”（beau），与“bro”押韵，有点类似但更高大上。罗的父亲去世了，约翰赌掉了他的遗产，不得不卖掉城堡来还债。在典型的“够意思”模式下，他被他的妈妈保释出来，她有自己的遗产；她从他那里买下了城堡，以保持它处于家庭中的控制之下，并使劳不被债务人的监狱所困。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the spring of the next year&mdash;on April 9, 1694, just as he was turning twenty-three&mdash;John Law had an encounter that would lead (indirectly, but still) to one of the biggest, wildest experiments in the history of money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在第二年的春天 —— 1694 年 4 月 9 日，就在他 23 岁的时候 —— 约翰-劳有了一次遭遇，这将导致（间接地，但仍然）货币史上最大、最疯狂的实验之一。

<p class="calibre9">Law was standing in Bloomsbury Square, on the outskirts of London, in the middle of the day, as a carriage rolled up. A young man got out, walked up to Law, and drew his sword. Law drew his own sword and struck the other man. The other man fell down and died.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">中午时分，劳站在伦敦郊区的布鲁姆斯伯里广场上，一辆马车驶来。一个年轻人下了车，走到劳的面前，拔出了他的剑。劳拔出自己的剑，打了另一个人。另一个人倒下了，死了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The other man was Edward Wilson, who, like Law, was a young London beau. The encounter was a duel, planned in advance to resolve a dispute. Nobody knows what the fight was about, but, like most fights, it probably had something to do with money or love or honor.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">另一个人是爱德华·威尔逊，他和劳一样，是一个年轻的伦敦大哥。这次相遇是一场决斗，是为了解决争端而事先计划的。没有人知道这场战斗是为了什么，但是，像大多数战斗一样，它可能与金钱、爱情或荣誉有关。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Wilson was the fifth son of a middling, indebted aristocrat, yet he lived like the richest man in London. No one knew where all his money came from. Some people gossiped at the time that the king’s mistress fell in love with Wilson and funneled him royal money. Thirty years later, an anonymous pamphlet appeared suggesting another story: “Love-Letters Between a Certain Late Nobleman and the Famous Mr. Wilson: Discovering the True History of the Rise and Surprising Grandeur of that Celebrated Beau.” Maybe a certain late nobleman had been giving Wilson hush money. One of Law’s most recent and most thorough biographers, the economist Antoin Murphy, suggests that someone&mdash;the king or the nobleman&mdash;wanted to keep Wilson from telling his secrets, and somehow persuaded Law to kill Wilson.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">威尔逊是一个中等的、负债累累的贵族的第五个儿子，但他却活得像伦敦最富有的人。没有人知道他所有的钱是怎么来的。当时有人八卦说，国王的情妇爱上了威尔逊，并向他输送了皇家资金。30 年后，一本匿名的小册子出现，暗示了另一个故事。“某位已故贵族与著名的威尔逊先生之间的情书。发现那个著名的美男子的崛起和惊人的伟大的真实历史”。也许某位已故贵族一直在给威尔逊提供封口费。罗的最新和最彻底的传记作者之一，经济学家安托万·墨菲认为，有人 —— 国王或贵族 —— 想阻止威尔逊说出他的秘密，并以某种方式劝说劳杀死威尔逊。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Law was living with a woman who was married to another man. Wilson’s sister for a while was living in the same building as Law, then left in a huff, offended by the sin going on under her roof. Wilson found out about it and confronted Law. According to one version of the story, that is what led to the duel.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 劳与一个已婚女人住在一起。威尔逊的妹妹曾有一段时间与劳住在同一栋楼里，后来因她屋檐下发生的罪恶而愤然离开。威尔逊发现了这件事，并与劳对峙。根据故事的一个版本，这就是导致决斗的原因。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Whatever the cause of the fight, the crime was clear. Dueling was illegal in seventeenth century England, and Law was arrested, thrown in jail, and convicted of the murder of Edward Wilson. He was sentenced to death by hanging. (Four other people were sentenced to be hanged at the same time. Two of them were sentenced for creating counterfeit coins, and one was sentenced for trimming silver off existing coins. As in medieval China, the British government killed people to try to keep the money sound.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">无论这场战斗的原因是什么，罪行都是明确的。在十七世纪的英国，决斗是非法的，劳被逮捕，被关进监狱，并被判定为谋杀爱德华·威尔逊的罪行。他被判处绞刑。(还有四个人同时被判处绞刑）。其中两人因制造假币被判刑，一人因在现有硬币上修剪银子被判刑。就像在中世纪的中国一样，英国政府杀了一些人，以试图保持货币的健全。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law didn’t expect to be killed. Dueling was relatively common among gentlemen, and no one could remember anybody being put to death for it. Initially, it looked like the king would pardon him. But Wilson’s family fought against a pardon. The king wavered; Law languished.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳可不想死。决斗在绅士中是比较常见的，没有人记得有人因为决斗而被处死。最初，看起来国王会赦免他。但威尔逊的家人反对赦免。国王动摇了；法律被搁置了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, in the first week of 1695, Law escaped from the King’s Bench Prison. The details are unclear, but from letters written at the time it appears that Law had powerful friends who got the warden to look the other way while an accomplice drugged the guards and opened the door of Law’s cell. Law, now a fugitive, got on a boat to Europe.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后，在 1695 年的第一周，劳从国王座监狱逃跑了。细节不清楚，但从当时写的信中可以看出，劳有一些有势力的朋友，他们让典狱长睁一只眼闭一只眼，而一个同伙给看守下药，打开了劳的牢房门。劳现在是一名逃犯，他上了一艘前往欧洲的船。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He was about to discover an intellectual revolution that was changing the way people thought about the future and about money. Law would use that revolution to get rich.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他即将发现一场认知革命，它正在改变人们对未来和金钱的思考方式。劳将利用这场革命致富。</p>

</h1>
<p class="noindent">The next ten years of Law’s life are obscure. He disappears from the historical record, then pops up in Paris, and in Venice, and in Amsterdam. Every time he emerges from the mist, he is gambling with local elites. And every time, he wins. It’s not that he was lucky. It doesn’t seem like he cheated. Law won because he discovered an intellectual discipline&mdash;a way of looking at the world&mdash;that was emerging during his lifetime and that would eventually shape the way millions of people thought about God, money, death, and the unknown future. The discipline is probability theory. It’s the basis of much of modern finance and, for that matter, much of modern thought. It was invented by gamblers.</p>

<p class="noindent">接下来十年劳的生活是模糊的。他从历史记录中消失了，然后在巴黎、威尼斯和阿姆斯特丹突然出现。每次他从迷雾中出现时，他都在与当地的精英们进行赌博。而每一次，他都会赢。这并不是说他很幸运。似乎也不是他作弊。劳赢了，因为他发现了一门知识学科 —— 一种看待世界的方式 —— 这门学科在他生前正在兴起，最终将塑造数百万人对上帝、金钱、死亡和未知未来的思考方式。这门学科就是概率论。它是许多现代金融的基础，也是许多现代思想的基础。它是由赌徒发明的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People had been gambling forever; four-sided knucklebones used as dice have been found in ancient archaeological sites around the world. But, almost unbelievably to our modern sensibility, gamblers had never really done the math. They knew that some outcomes were more likely than others. But they knew it in a fuzzy, qualitative way. Now, finally, gamblers started to calculate exactly how likely they were to win or lose. At a time when most people still  thought of outcomes as luck or divine providence, doing the math at the gambling table was like having a superpower.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们一直都在赌博；在世界各地的古代考古遗址中发现了用作骰子的四面指骨。但是，对我们现代人来说，几乎是不可思议的是，赌徒们从来没有真正算过账。他们知道有些结果比其他结果更有可能。但他们知道的是一种模糊的、定性的方式。现在，赌徒们终于开始准确地计算出他们的输赢可能性。在大多数人仍然认为结果是运气或天意的时候，在赌桌上做数学题就像拥有一种超能力。</p>

<p class="calibre9">One of the most important of the gambler-mathematicians was the weirdo genius Blaise Pascal. As a teenager, he had written a treatise on geometry that was good enough to impress Descartes (who was in the midst of inventing a branch of modern geometry). He invented a mechanical calculator, which he named after himself (the Pascaline), which never took off, possibly because it was too expensive to produce. For a while, when he was in his twenties, Pascal had a religious crisis and gave up gambling. “Who has placed me here?” he wrote. “By whose order and warrant was this place and this time ordained for me? The eternal silence of these infinite spaces leaves me in terror.” When he was twenty-seven, these intense questions caused a sort of physical breakdown&mdash;headaches, difficulty swallowing&mdash;so he turned his back on the existential abyss and walked back to the gambling tables.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">赌徒数学家中最重要的一位是怪人天才布莱斯·帕斯卡。在十几岁的时候，他写了一篇关于几何学的论文，其优秀程度足以打动笛卡尔（他当时正在发明现代几何学的一个分支）。他发明了一个机械计算器，并以自己的名字命名（Pascaline），该计算器从未真正做出来，可能是因为生产成本太高。有一段时间，当他 20 多岁时，帕斯卡尔出现了宗教危机，放弃了赌博。“是谁把我放在这里的？”他写道，“这个地方和这个时间是根据谁的命令和授权为我规定的？这些无限空间的永恒寂静让我感到恐惧。”当他二十七岁时，这些强烈的问题导致了某种身体的崩溃 —— 头痛，吞咽困难 —— 所以他离开了这个存在着的深渊，走回了赌桌。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1654, a French mathematician and gambler called the Chevalier de Méré asked Pascal a couple of questions. One was about the probability of rolling double sixes given several chances. The other was a deeper, more complicated question that gamblers had been puzzling over for more than a century.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1654 年，一位名叫梅雷骑士（Chevalier de Méré）的法国数学家和赌徒问了帕斯卡尔几个问题。一个是关于在有限次数内，掷出双六的概率。另一个是更深层次、更复杂的问题，赌徒们已经为之困惑了一个多世纪了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was known as the “problem of the points,” and it went like this. Two players put money in the pot and agree that whoever wins a certain number of rounds of a game will take the pot. It can be any game of chance&mdash;dice rolls, coin flips, whatever. The players start the game, but they have to stop before they’ve completed the agreed number of rounds. What’s a fair system for splitting the pot based on the score when the game is stopped?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这被称为“点数问题”，它是这样的。两个玩家把钱放进罐里，并同意谁在某个游戏中赢得一定数量的回合，谁就可以拿走整罐钱。它可以是任何机会游戏 —— 掷骰子，抛硬币，任何东西。玩家开始游戏，但在完成约定的回合数之前，他们必须停止。在游戏停止时，根据分数分割彩金的公平制度是什么？</p>

<p class="calibre9">These questions inspired Pascal to write to Pierre de Fermat, a lawyer who moonlighted as a math genius. They sent letters back  and forth for a few months, working on the problems. The problem of rolling double sixes was easy. The problem of the points took a little longer&mdash;and the solution Pascal and Fermat worked out had a more profound impact on the history of money, and of human thought.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这些问题激发了帕斯卡尔给皮埃尔·德·费马写信，他是一位兼职数学天才的律师。他们在几个月内来回寄信，研究这些问题。滚动双六的问题很容易。点的问题花了一点时间，而帕斯卡尔和费马研究出来的解决方案对货币的历史和人类思想产生了更深远的影响。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Here’s a simple example of the problem. Say you and I each put £50 into the pot, and agree that all £100 will go to whoever wins a best-of-three series of coin flips. You bet on heads, I bet on tails. You flip once; it comes up heads. Then we have to stop the game before we have time to flip again. You’re up one to zero. How should we split the £100?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">下面是这个问题的一个简单例子。假设你和我各投入 50 英镑，并同意三局两胜者获得所有的 100 英镑。你赌正面，我赌反面。你抛一次，结果是正面。因为现在没时间了，我们必须停止游戏。你以 1 比 0 领先。我们应该如何分配这 100 英镑？</p>

<p class="calibre9">Pascal and Fermat’s insight was to consider every possible outcome of the game, and then figure out what percentage of the outcomes each player would win and split the pot accordingly. They worked out the math in detail, but we can look at the simple example below without getting into much math.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">帕斯卡尔和费马的见解是考虑游戏的每一个可能的结果，然后算出每个玩家会赢得多少百分比的结果，并相应地分出彩金。他们对数学进行了详细的研究，但我们可以看看下面这个简单的例子，而不必深入研究数学。</p>

<p class="calibre9">If we stop a best-of-three bet after a single flip, when you have one heads and I have zero tails, here are the possible outcomes of the two remaining flips:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果我们在一局后停止三局两胜的赌局，当你有一次正面，而我有零次反面，下面是剩余两次翻牌的可能结果：</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre5">heads, heads (you win)</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre5">tails, heads (you win)</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre5">heads, tails (you win)</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre5">tails, tails (I win)</li>
</ol>

<ol class="calibre10">
  <li value="1" class="calibre5 cn">正面，正面（你赢）</li>
  <li value="2" class="calibre5 cn">反面，正面（你赢）</li>
  <li value="3" class="calibre5 cn">正面，反面（你赢）</li>

<p class="calibre9">You win 75 percent of the time (three out of four), and I win 25 percent of the time (one out of four). Of the £100 in the pot, you should get £75 and I should get £25.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">你赢了 75%（四分之三），而我赢了 25%（四分之一）。在彩池的 100 英镑中，你应该得到 75 英镑，我应该得到 25 英镑。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> What is maybe most surprising about this solution is how unsurprising it seems to us. So obvious! What is so extraordinary&mdash;the whole point of the story&mdash;is that, in thousands of years of gambling, as far as we know, nobody had figured it out before, because people did not think about the uncertain future as something you could calculate. The future was determined by chance, or the gods, or God; it was not determined by math. That’s why this was such a transformative moment in the history of thought, and of money. It’s why a Stanford mathematician recently wrote an entire book about Pascal and Fermat’s solution to this problem: “It set out, for the first time, a method whereby humans can predict the future.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这个解决方案最令人惊讶的是它在我们看来是多么的不令人惊讶。如此明显! 这个故事的重点是，据我们所知，在几千年的赌博史上，以前没有人想出这个办法，因为人们不认为不确定的未来是可以计算出来的。未来是由机会，或神，或上帝决定的；它不是由数学决定的。这就是为什么这是思想史和货币史上的一个变革时刻。这就是为什么斯坦福大学的一位数学家最近写了一整本书来介绍帕斯卡尔和费马对这个问题的解决方案：“它首次提出了一种人类可以预测未来的方法。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few years after his correspondence with Fermat, Pascal went back to the edge of the existential abyss. But he brought this new kind of thinking with him. “God is, or He is not,” Pascal wrote. “But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here.… A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在与费马通信的几年后，帕斯卡回到了存在主义深渊的边缘。但他带来了这种新的思考方式。“上帝在，或他不在”，帕斯卡尔写道，"但我们应该倾向于哪一边？理性在这里不能决定什么…… 在这个无限的距离的极端，正在进行一场游戏，正面或反面都会出现。你要赌什么？” </p>

<p class="calibre9">If you wager that “God is” (for Pascal, this meant the Christian God), and you win, what you get is “an eternity of life and happiness.” If you bet that “God is not,” and you win, you get to be right. It’s a bet where the payoff for one side is infinitely larger than the payoff for the other side&mdash;an eternity of life and happiness versus being right. The choice is obvious. “Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果你打赌说“上帝在”（对帕斯卡尔来说，这意味着基督教的上帝），并且你赢了，你得到的是“生命和幸福的永恒”。如果你打赌说 “上帝不在”，并且你赢了，你得到的是正确的。这是一个赌注，其中一方的回报比另一方的回报要大得多 —— 生命和幸福的永恒与正确相比。这个选择是显而易见的。“那么，就毫不犹豫地赌他在。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Pascal made that bet. His mathematical thinking inspired him to give up math, sell almost everything he owned, and move into a monastery. Probabilistic thinking had jumped the species barrier. Now it wasn’t just about dice and money; it was about everything.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">帕斯卡尔打了这个赌。他的数学思维启发他放弃了数学，卖掉了他拥有的几乎所有东西，并搬进了一个修道院。概率论思维已经跳出了物种的障碍。现在，它不仅仅是关于骰子和金钱；它是关于一切。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-127" class="sect1">Probability in the Wild 野外的概率</h1>

<p class="noindent">The ideas of Pascal and Fermat spread quickly among Europe’s intellectuals. A few decades later, their ideas reached John Law (this was presumably after he nearly lost the family castle at the gambling table). “No man understood calculation and numbers better than he,” one of Law’s friends wrote. “He was the first man in England that was at pains to find out… all the other chances of the dice.”</p>

<p class="noindent">帕斯卡和费马的思想在欧洲的知识分子中迅速传播。几十年后，他们的思想传到了约翰·劳（这大概是在他差点在赌桌上输掉家族城堡之后）。“没有人比他更了解计算和数字”，劳的一个朋友写道，“他是英国第一个不遗余力地找出…… 骰子的所有可能性的人。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law would hand a player a six-sided die and offer 10,000-to-1 odds against rolling six sixes in a row. He knew that the odds of doing so were roughly 1 in 50,000 (or 1 in 6<sup class="calibre11">6</sup>). When he was on the lam in Paris in the early 1700s, he arrived at the gambling tables with bags full of gold. He would often play the role of the house, or the banker, in games where the odds slightly favored the house. He kept winning. His bets eventually grew so large that he had his own gold chips minted.</p>


<p class="calibre9 cn">劳会递给玩家一个六面骰子，为连续掷出六个六提供一万比一的赔率。他知道，这样实际的概率大约是五万分之一（或六分之一的六次方）。十七世纪初，当他在巴黎逃亡时，他带着满满一袋黄金来到赌桌前。他经常 坐 庄，玩赔率略微偏向庄的游戏。他不断地赢钱。他的赌注最终变得如此之大，以至于他自己铸造了黄金筹码。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As Law was using probability to get rich, his contemporaries were using it to change the way people thought about death (and money). Up until this time, people thought about death sort of like they thought about dice: they knew it was more likely for some people (babies, old people) than for others (teenagers). But they didn’t know it by the numbers. They were like gamblers before probability theory: they didn’t do the math.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在劳利用概率致富的同时，他的同时代人也在利用概率改变人们对死亡（和金钱）的思考方式。在这之前，人们对死亡的思考有点像他们对骰子的思考：他们知道有些人（婴儿、老人）比其他人（青少年）更可能死亡。但他们并不了解这些数字。他们就像概率论出现之前的赌徒：他们没有做数学题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This turned out to be a big problem for European governments, which raised money at the time not by collecting regular income taxes, but by selling annuities (among other schemes). To buy an annuity, I pay the government a lump sum (say, £1,000) and in exchange the government promises me a fixed annual payment (say, £70) for the rest of my life.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这变成了欧洲政府的一个大问题，当时他们不是通过定期收取所得税，而是通过出售年金（以及其他计划）来筹集资金。为了购买年金，我向政府一次性支付一笔钱（比如 1000 英镑），作为交换，政府承诺在我的余生中每年支付一笔固定的款项（比如 70 英镑）。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> An annuity is, awkwardly, a bet on how long the buyer will live. If I buy an annuity today, and I die tomorrow, the government gets to keep all my money and doesn’t have to pay me anything. I lose, and the government wins. If I live to one hundred, the government has to send me those sweet, sweet annuity checks every year for decades. The government loses, and I win. In John Law’s day, governments and their citizens were making these bets, but nobody knew how long people were likely to live. They were playing dice, but they didn’t know the odds.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 尴尬的是，年金是对购买者将活多久的一种赌注。如果我今天买了年金，而我明天就死了，政府就可以保留我所有的钱，而不需要支付给我任何东西。我输了，而政府赢了。如果我活到一百岁，政府就得在几十年里每年给我寄那些甜蜜的年金支票。政府输了，而我赢了。在约翰·劳的时代，政府和他们的公民都在做这些赌注，但没有人知道人们可能会活多久。他们在玩骰子，但他们不知道赔率。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In England at the time, an annuity was the same price no matter the age of the person who bought it. So everybody started buying annuities for their teenage kids, who were likely to live a long time and make a huge profit. Good for the kids, bad for England.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在当时的英国，无论购买者的年龄大小，年金都是一样的价格。因此，每个人都开始为他们十几岁的孩子购买年金，这些孩子可能会活很久，并获得巨大的利润。对孩子们来说是好事，对英国来说是坏事。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The British mathematician Edmond Halley knew of the work of Pascal and Fermat and figured the math for annuities should be solvable. By the time he was thirty-three years old, Halley had already traveled halfway around the world to map the stars, and helped his pal Isaac Newton publish <em class="calibre4">The Principia</em> , the book that laid out the theory of gravity. (Predicting the return of an as-yet-unnamed comet was still a few years off for Halley.) Around this time, he became editor of this new kind of thing, a scientific journal, and he had the same problem that every editor of every publication has had for all of history: he had to find stuff to fill up his pages. So when he heard about this Eastern European town called Breslaw, where they kept unusually good records of citizens’ births and deaths, he had an idea.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">英国数学家埃德蒙·哈雷（Edmond Halley）知道帕斯卡尔和费马的工作，并认为年金的数学应该是可以解决的。在他 33 岁的时候，哈雷已经走遍了半个地球，绘制了星图，并帮助他的朋友艾萨克·牛顿出版了《原理》（<em>The Principia</em>）一书，该书提出了万有引力理论。(对哈雷来说，预测一颗尚未命名的彗星的回归还需要几年时间。）大约在这个时候，他成为这种新事物的编辑，一份科学杂志，他遇到了历史上每个出版物的编辑都会遇到的同样问题：他必须找到东西来填充他的页面。因此，当他听说东欧有一个叫布雷斯洛（Breslaw）的小镇，那里对公民的出生和死亡保持着异常良好的记录时，他有了一个想法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In January 1693, Halley published “An Estimate of the Degrees of the Mortality of Mankind, drawn from curious Tables of the Births and Funerals at the City of Breslaw; with an Attempt to ascertain the Price of Annuities upon Lives.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1693 年 1 月，哈雷发表了《对人类死亡率程度的估计，这是从布雷斯劳的出生和死亡的奇特表格中得出的；并试图确定生命年金的价格》。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> In the very first sentence he ran straight at the heart of his subject with the all promiscuous capitalization of the era: “The contemplation of the Mortality of Mankind, has besides the Moral, its Physical and Political Uses.…” <em class="calibre4">Yes, I know, death is bound up with everything deep about being human, but also it’s a physical thing in the world and we need to understand what it means for us as a nation.</em> Halley shouted out the few other people who had recently tried to analyze the mortality rate for citizens of London and Dublin, but he pointed out that none of them had access to all the information they needed, because nobody in London or Dublin was keeping close enough track of births and deaths. Now, these records from Breslaw had appeared.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在第一句话中，他就以那个时代的所有杂乱无章的大写字母直指其主题的核心。对人类死亡的思考，除了道德上的，还有身体和政治上的用途…… 是的，我知道，死亡与作为人类的一切深层事物联系在一起，但它也是世界上的一种物质，我们需要了解它对我们这个国家意味着什么。”哈雷大声说，最近还有几个人试图分析伦敦和都柏林公民的死亡率，但他指出，他们都无法获得他们需要的所有信息，因为在伦敦或都柏林没有人对出生和死亡进行足够密切的跟踪。现在，这些来自布雷斯洛的记录已经出现了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then Halley started doing lots of math. And after complaining about the “most laborious calculation,” he figured out exactly how likely people of different ages were to die. Someone who just turned twenty had a 1 percent chance of dying before her next birthday. A fifty-year-old had a 3 percent chance of dying before age fifty-one. “A man of 30 may reasonably expect to live between 27 and 28 years,” he wrote. And so on.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后哈雷开始做大量的数学计算。在抱怨“最费力的计算”之后，他准确地算出了不同年龄的人死亡的可能性。一个刚满 20 岁的人有 1% 的机会在她下一个生日前死亡。一个 50 岁的人有 3% 的机会在 51 岁之前死亡。他写道：“一个 30 岁的男人可以合理地预期活 27 至 28 年……”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Halley thought an annuity would be fairly priced if the buyer who lived exactly as long as the average person got paid back exactly as much as she put in. If she died early, she’d collect less than she put in; if she lived longer, she’d collect more. And he saw clearly that England was selling its annuities too cheaply: everybody under age sixty was likely to get more back than they put in.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">哈雷认为，如果一个和普通人一样长寿的买家得到的回报和她投入的一样多，那么年金的价格就会很公平。如果她早死，她得到的钱比她投入的少；如果她活得长，她得到的钱就多。他清楚地看到，英国的年金卖得太便宜了：所有 60 岁以下的人都可能得到比他们投入更多的回报。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This wasn’t just some random set of morbid facts or a useful piece of accounting. It was a method. Given the data of births and deaths for a given population, anybody could now figure out how likely people were to die at any age. Halley had solved the problem of the points, but for life itself.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这不仅仅是一些随机的病态的事实，也不是一个有用的会计。它是一种方法。鉴于特定人口的出生和死亡数据，任何人现在都可以计算出人们在任何年龄段死亡的可能性。哈雷解决了点数的问题，但对生命本身来说，也同样。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> A few decades later, a pair of hard-drinking Scottish ministers named Alexander Webster and Robert Wallace thought Halley’s tables from a random town in Central Europe might help them with a problem they were trying to solve: how to provide for the wives and children of Scottish ministers who died young.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 几十年后，一对名叫亚历山大·韦伯斯特（Alexander Webster）和罗伯特·华莱士（Robert Wallace）的酗酒的苏格兰大臣认为，来自中欧一个随机小镇的哈雷表可能有助于他们解决一个问题：如何为早逝的苏格兰大臣的妻子和子女提供食物。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Life insurance was already a thing but, as with annuities before Halley came along, nobody really knew the odds. Like annuities, life insurance is a bet on how long the insured will live, but the winners and losers are reversed. As a buyer, I win (“win”) if I buy a policy and then die right away, so my family gets a big payout when I’ve only paid in a little bit. But of course it only works if the life insurance company has the money to pay. If the company runs out of money because it’s been selling policies too cheaply, my family is out of luck.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人寿保险早已经出现了，但是，就像哈雷出现之前的年金一样，没有人真正知道赔率。与年金一样，人寿保险也是对被保险人寿命长短的一种赌注，但赢家和输家是相反的。作为买方，如果我买了保单，然后马上死亡，我就赢了，所以我的家人得到了一大笔赔款，而我只付了一点。但当然，这只有在寿险公司有钱支付的情况下才行得通。如果该公司因为销售保单的价格太低而耗尽了资金，我的家人就没戏了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">To launch the Scottish Ministers’ Widows’ Fund, Wallace and Webster used Halley’s tables, and the new science of probability, and the help of a mathematician friend, to estimate how much each minister had to chip in. Wallace and Webster predicted there would be £47,401 in the fund ten years after it launched. The prediction was phenomenally accurate: the real figure turned out to be £47,313. They were off by less than 1 percent. An intellectual revolution made this possible. People were thinking in a new way&mdash;a way that was colder, and more mathy&mdash;and that bound life and death up with money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">为了启动苏格兰大臣遗孀基金，华莱士和韦伯斯特利用哈雷表和新的概率科学，并在一位数学家朋友的帮助下，估算出每位大臣必须拿出多少钱。华莱士和韦伯斯特预测，基金启动十年后将有 47,401 英镑的资金。这个预测非常准确：实际数字是 47,313 英镑。他们的误差还不到 1%。一场知识革命使这成为可能。人们以一种新的方式思考，一种更冷酷、更数学化的方式，将生命和死亡与金钱联系起来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Insurance and annuities were a way of recapturing some (but not all) of the reciprocity that was present in small, pre-money societies. Because lots of ministers paid life insurance premiums and lived long lives, there was money to support the wives and children of the ministers who died young. Today, almost every rich society on Earth has some kind of social insurance&mdash;like, say, Social Security in the United States. Because millions of workers put a little  money into the pot from every paycheck, millions of people who are too old to work get to take a little money out.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">保险和年金是一种重新获得一些（但不是全部）互惠的方式，这种互惠存在于小型的、前货币社会中。由于许多大臣支付了人寿保险费并长寿，因此有资金支持早逝的大臣的妻子和子女。今天，地球上几乎每个富裕的社会都有某种社会保险 —— 比如说美国的社会保险。因为数以百万计的工人从每份工资中拿出一点钱放到池子里，数以百万计年老不能工作的人可以拿出一点钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Probabilistic thinking has become so ubiquitous we’ve almost stopped noticing it. Insurance, of course, is still built on probability. But so are finance and business and sports and politics and medicine. We’ve come to take as given the revolutionary idea that we can predict the future.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">概率思维已经变得无处不在，我们几乎已经不再注意到它。当然，保险仍然建立在概率之上。但金融、商业、体育、政治和医学也是如此。我们已经把可以预测未来这一革命性的想法视为既定事实。</p>

</h1>
<p class="noindent">It’s a stretch to say that modern capitalism was invented in Amsterdam in the space of a few years in the early 1600s. But only a little bit of a stretch.</p>

<p class="noindent">如果说现代资本主义是在十六世纪初的几年时间里在阿姆斯特丹发明的，这有点牵强 —— 可实际上，只是有一点点夸张而已。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At the time, Europeans were really into sailing around the world and getting rich trading and stealing stuff from faraway lands. The Dutch were sending ships south around Africa and over to modern-day Indonesia and bringing back spices like nutmeg and mace. (Nutmeg and mace were huge in 1600; rich people paid absurd amounts to stock their spice drawers.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时，欧洲人非常喜欢在世界各地航行，通过贸易和偷窃远方的东西来发财。荷兰人派船向南绕过非洲，前往现代的印度尼西亚，带回了肉豆蔻和肉豆蔻等香料。(肉豆蔻和肉豆蔻在 1600 年非常流行；有钱人花了很多钱来储存他们的香料抽屉。）</p>

<p class="calibre9">But as Dutch merchants tried to send ships out for dangerous, multi-year voyages, they came up against a classic problem. They had a plan to make tons of money, but they had to spend a ton to put the plan in action. They had to build or buy ships, recruit a captain and a crew, and then send the ships and the captain and the crew around the world and back. There are infinite versions of this need-money-to-make-money problem: I want to buy a car, so I can drive to my new job, so I can make more money. But I need the  money that I’m going to make at my new job now, so I can pay for the car, so I can drive to work, so I can make the money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但当荷兰商人试图派船进行危险的、多年的航行时，他们遇到了一个典型的问题。他们有一个赚大钱的计划，但他们不得不花大钱来实施这个计划。他们必须建造或购买船只，招募船长和船员，然后将船只、船长和船员送往世界各地并返回。这种从需要钱才能赚钱的问题有无限的版本：我想买一辆车，这样我就可以开车去我的新工作，这样我就可以赚更多的钱。但我现在就要在新工作中赚到的钱，那我就可以支付汽车，就可以开车去工作，就可以赚钱了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fortunately, there are other people who have more money than they need right now. And they are willing to give up spending that money now so that they can have the chance of getting even more money later. This is how I can get a car loan, and how the Dutch got money to send ships to Asia, and it is one of the fundamentally useful things finance does: matches people who are willing to give up money now for the possibility of more money later with people who need money now and are willing to pay back more money later. Finance moves money around in time. “The essence of finance is time travel,” the banker-turned-writer Matt Levine wrote. “Saving is about moving resources from the present into the future; financing is about moving resources from the future back into the present.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">幸运的是，还有一些人的钱比他们现在需要的还要多。而且他们愿意放弃现在花这些钱，以便以后有机会得到更多的钱。这就是我如何获得汽车贷款的原因，也是荷兰人如何获得资金将船只送往亚洲的原因，这也是金融的基本作用之一：将那些愿意放弃现在的钱以换取以后可能获得更多钱的人与那些现在需要钱并愿意以后偿还更多钱的人相匹配。金融在时间上移动资金。“金融的本质是时间旅行”，由银行家转为作家的马特·莱文写道。“储蓄是将资源从现在移到未来；融资是将资源从未来移回现在。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Those early voyages to the Spice Islands were usually financed as one-off deals. A bunch of rich people would pool their money to pay for a ship. If the ship made it all the way to Indonesia and back with a fortune in spices (no sure thing), then the investors would get their money back, with a profit on top. If the ship didn’t make it back, thanks for playing&mdash;and oh, by the way, can we interest you in our next opportunity?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那些早期前往香料群岛的航行通常是以一次性交易的方式进行融资的。一群有钱人会凑钱买一艘船。如果这艘船一路航行到印度尼西亚，然后带着一大笔香料回来（没有把握），那么投资者就可以拿回他们的钱，并在上面获得利润。如果船没能回来，谢谢你的参与 —— 哦，顺便说一句，我们能让你对我们的下一个机会感兴趣吗？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Spanish, the Portuguese, and the British were all fighting for a piece of the Spice Islands action. It was a mix of business and imperialism and war, and the scattered Dutch ships financed by merchants were starting to look outmatched. So in 1602, the Dutch government created this new thing countries were trying: a trading company. Its formal name was the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (United East India Company), or the VOC for short.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">西班牙人、葡萄牙人和英国人都在争夺香料群岛的利益。这是一场商业、帝国主义和战争的混合，由商人资助的分散的荷兰船只开始显得力不从心。因此，在 1602 年，荷兰政府创建了这个国家正在尝试的新事物：一个贸易公司。它的正式名称是联合东印度公司（Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie），或简称为 VOC。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The government granted the VOC a monopoly on all Dutch  trade in Asia. The English had done something similar two years before, creating their own East India Company. But the Dutch East India Company would evolve in a way that would make it the first modern multinational corporation&mdash;the predecessor of Coca-Cola and Google and ExxonMobil.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">政府授予 VOC 在亚洲所有荷兰贸易的垄断权。英国人在两年前也做过类似的事情，创建了自己的东印度公司。但荷兰联合东印度公司的发展方式将使其成为第一家现代跨国公司，也就是可口可乐、谷歌和埃克森美孚的前身。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People didn’t have to be rich or well connected to invest in the VOC. “All the residents of these lands may buy shares in this Company,” the charter said. This was in keeping with the spirit of the times. The Dutch had broken free from the King of Spain just a few decades earlier and formed a republic. It wasn’t anything like a democracy in the modern sense, but power was much more widely distributed in the Netherlands than in monarchies of the time. A huge range of people invested in the VOC&mdash;over 1,000 people in Amsterdam alone, including the maid of one of the directors of the company, who put in ten months’ salary.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们不一定要有钱或有关系才能投资 VOC。公司章程里说：“这些土地上的所有居民都可以购买本公司的股份。”这符合当时的时代精神。几十年前，荷兰人刚刚摆脱了西班牙国王的统治，成立了一个共和国。它并不像现代意义上的民主，但在荷兰，权力的分配比当时的君主制要广泛得多。大量的人投资于 VOC，仅在阿姆斯特丹就有 1000 多人，包括公司一位董事的女佣，她投入了十个月的工资。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At the time, companies everywhere could only be created by the explicit consent of the government, and they were always created to end after a fixed amount of time. The government gave the VOC a charter to operate for twenty-one years. Investors had the option of cashing out after ten years, but even that was a long time to wait. So in Amsterdam the directors of the VOC added a single line to the first page of the company register, the book where they recorded everyone’s investments: “conveyance or transfer may be done through the bookkeeper of this chamber.” In other words, if you want your money back before ten years have passed, you can sell your investment, your share of the company, to anyone who wants to buy it. This one line had a huge impact&mdash;not just on the VOC, but on the whole history of money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时，各地的公司只有在政府明确同意的情况下才能成立，而且这些公司的成立总是在一个固定的时间后结束。政府给了 VOC 一份经营 21 年的宪章。投资者可以选择在十年后兑现，但即使是这样，也是一个漫长的等待。因此，在阿姆斯特丹，VOC 的董事们在公司登记册的第一页增加了一行字，那是他们记录每个人的投资的书。“转让或转移可以通过本商会的簿记员进行”。换句话说，如果你想在十年前拿回你的钱，你可以把你的投资，你在公司的股份，卖给任何想买它的人。这一句话产生了巨大的影响 —— 不仅对 VOC，而且对整个金钱的历史产生了影响。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People started selling their shares even before the first ship sailed. It wasn’t particularly convenient; to execute a sale, the buyer  and the seller both had to go to the company office, where a bookkeeper had to record the deal in the register. But there were shareholders who needed money urgently, and nonshareholders who were willing to give up money now for the possibility of more money later. People who wanted to find buyers or sellers went to a bridge that ship captains crossed to deliver the mail when they came back from overseas. That made it the perfect place to get market-moving news before anyone else in town. Within a few years, there were so many traders on the bridge that they were blocking traffic. So the city commissioned a new building, just for trading&mdash;a courtyard 200 feet long by 115 feet wide, and surrounded by a covered gallery tiled in blue stone. It was the world’s first stock exchange.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">甚至在第一艘船起航之前，人们就开始出售他们的股票。这并不特别方便；要执行一项销售，买方和卖方都必须去公司办公室，那里的簿记员必须在登记簿上记录交易。但是，有的股东迫切需要钱，有的非股东愿意放弃现在的钱，以换取以后可能得到的更多钱。想找买家或卖家的人就去找船长从海外回来送信时经过的一座桥。这使得它成为在镇上其他人之前获得市场变动消息的完美场所。几年内，桥上的交易员多到阻碍交通。因此，该市建造了一座新的建筑，专门用于交易，一个长 200 英尺、宽 115 英尺的院子，周围是用蓝色石头铺成的有盖长廊。这就是世界上第一个证券交易所。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Five days before the exchange opened, the city passed a new ordinance, which said the exchange would only be allowed to be open a few hours a day&mdash;from 11 a.m. to noon, and again in the evening for an hour before dusk (thirty minutes in the winter). The limited hours sound like a pain, but there was a good reason for making this rule. If the market had been open all day, buyers and sellers would have trickled in and out. The spread between the price buyers were offering and the price sellers were asking would have been wide. People would have had to either make deals they didn’t want to make or go without trading at all. This is what economists call a “thin market.” The limited hours forced all potential buyers and sellers to show up at the same time&mdash;they turned the exchange into a “thick market,” where hundreds or even thousands of people would show up to trade at the same time. This made it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other and agree on a price both thought was fair. It made the market work better.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在交易所开业前五天，该市通过了一项新的法令，规定交易所每天只允许开放几个小时 —— 从上午十一点点到中午，晚上在黄昏前再开放一个小时（冬天是三十分钟）。有限的时间听起来很麻烦，但制定这一规则是有原因的。如果市场全天开放，买家和卖家就会源源不断地进入和离开。买家提供的价格和卖家要求的价格之间的差距会很大。人们将不得不做他们不想做的交易，或者根本不做交易。这就是经济学家所说的“稀缺市场”。有限的时间迫使所有潜在的买家和卖家在同一时间出现 —— 他们把交易所变成了一个“密集市场”，数百甚至数千人将在同一时间出现进行交易。这使得买家和卖家更容易找到对方，并就双方认为公平的价格达成一致。它使市场运作得更好。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As the VOC’s charter was renewed, and renewed again, the stock exchange became an institution. A local merchant-poet named  Joseph de la Vega wrote a book about Amsterdam’s stock market. It was the first book ever written about a stock market, and it had the perfect name for a book about the market: <em class="calibre4">Confusion of Confusions</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着 VOC 的特许证被续签，再续签，证券交易所也成为一种制度。一位名叫约瑟夫·德拉维加的当地商人诗人写了一本关于阿姆斯特丹股票市场的书。这是有史以来第一本关于股票市场的书，而且它有一个关于市场的完美名字：《混乱的混乱》（<em class="calibre4">Confusion of Confusions</em>）。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The book is full of weird digressions into classical mythology and biblical analogies. But the descriptions of the stock exchange are shockingly familiar:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这本书充满了对古典神话和圣经类比的奇怪离题。但对证券交易所的描述却令人震惊：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">A member of the Exchange opens his hand and another takes it, and thus sells a number of shares at a fixed price, which is confirmed by a second handshake.… The handshakes are followed by shouting, the shouting by insults, the insults by impudence and more insults, shouting, pushes, and handshakes until the business is finished…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">交易所的一名成员张开手，另一名成员握住他的手，从而以固定的价格卖出一定数量的股票，这被第二次握手所确认…… 握手之后是喊叫，喊叫之后是辱骂，辱骂之后是无礼和更多的辱骂、喊叫、推搡和握手，直到生意结束……</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">Almost as soon as people started trading stocks, they also started coming up with complex variations that allowed for new kinds of bets. One kind of bet in particular emerged almost immediately: a short, which allows an investor to profit when the price of the stock goes down. People in Amsterdam hated shorts, as people around the world have continued to hate them ever since.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几乎在人们开始交易股票的同时，他们也开始想出复杂的变化，允许新种类的投注。其中有一种赌注几乎是立即出现的：空头，它允许投资者在股票价格下跌时获利。阿姆斯特丹的人们讨厌空头，就像全世界的人们从那时起就一直讨厌空头一样。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-138" class="sect1">Short Story 做空的故事</h1>
<p class="noindent">The story of the first stock short in the history of the world explains the hate&mdash;but also why shorting is socially useful and wildly underrated.</p>

<p class="noindent">世界历史上第一个股票做空的故事解释了仇恨 —— 但也解释了为什么做空在社会上是有用的，而且被疯狂地低估。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Isaac Le Maire was a Dutch merchant, a founder of the VOC, and the single biggest shareholder in Amsterdam. A few years into the life of the company, Le Maire got into a fight with the other directors. The details are obscure, but it seems that he had financed  part of an expedition, and the company didn’t pay him back what he said he was owed. Le Maire may have inflated his expenses to defraud the company. There was a lawsuit; the directors froze Le Maire’s shares. Le Maire left Amsterdam, holed up in the countryside, and plotted his revenge.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">艾萨克·勒梅尔（Isaac Le Maire）是一名荷兰商人，是 VOC 的创始人，也是阿姆斯特丹最大的单一股东。在公司成立几年后，勒梅尔与其他董事发生了争执。细节不详，但似乎他资助了一次远征的一部分，而公司没有偿还他说欠他的钱。勒梅尔可能夸大了他的开支，以欺骗公司，由此发生了一场诉讼；董事们冻结了勒梅尔的股份。勒梅尔离开阿姆斯特丹，躲在乡下，策划着他的报复。</p>

<p class="calibre9">To get back at the VOC, Le Maire used a technique that local grain dealers had been using for a long time. Two people would agree to a sale at a certain price at a set date in the future. So, for example, one merchant might promise to buy a bushel of wheat for 100 guilders a year from today. This is called a futures contract, and today people make trillions of dollars in deals in contracts like these.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">为了报复 VOC，勒梅尔使用了当地粮食经销商长期以来一直使用的技巧。两个人同意在未来的某个日期以一定的价格进行销售。因此，例如，一个商人可能承诺从今天起一年后以 100 盾购买一蒲式耳小麦。这被称为期货合约，今天人们在这样的合约中进行了数万亿美元的交易。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Working secretly through a team of confederates, Le Maire started entering into futures contracts for VOC stock. In October 1608 a trader working with Le Maire made a deal with an Amsterdam diamond merchant. Le Maire’s trader agreed to sell the diamond merchant a share of VOC stock for 145 guilders in one year’s time. This meant that if the stock was trading below 145 when the contract came due, Le Maire could buy a share on the open market, turn around and immediately sell it to the diamond merchant at a profit. And the lower the price of the stock, the bigger Le Maire’s profit. Le Maire made lots of deals like these, eventually entering into contracts for more shares than he actually owned. If the price of the stock went down a lot, he’d get rich. If it went up a lot, he’d be wiped out.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">通过一个同盟者团队的秘密工作，勒梅尔开始签订 VOC 股票的期货合约。1608 年 10 月，与勒梅尔合作的一名交易员与阿姆斯特丹的一名钻石商进行了交易。勒梅尔的交易员同意在一年后以 145 盾的价格向该钻石商出售 VOC 股票的份额。这意味着，如果合同到期时股票价格低于 145 盾，勒梅尔可以在公开市场上买入一股，转身后立即卖给钻石商人，从中获利。而股票价格越低，勒梅尔的利润就越大。勒梅尔做了很多这样的交易，最终签订的合同比他实际拥有的股票还要多。如果股票价格下跌了很多，他就会发财。如果价格上涨了很多，他就会被消灭掉。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So Le Maire started trying to drive the price of the stock down. His confederates in Amsterdam spread rumors about problems with the VOC. The company was spending too much money. Ships were sinking and getting captured by the enemy. Profits weren’t as high as everybody thought they’d be. Sure enough, the price of VOC shares started falling.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">于是勒梅尔开始试图压低股票的价格。他在阿姆斯特丹的同盟者散布了关于 VOC 问题的谣言。该公司花了太多的钱。船只不断沉没，被敌人俘虏。利润并不像大家想象的那样高。果然，VOC 的股票价格开始下跌。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The directors of the company didn’t know that Le Maire was involved, but they knew someone was betting on the price of shares falling, and heard the rumors about the company, and they knew that the price was falling. The VOC was a source of both national pride and international power for the Dutch. For the sake of the nation (and for the sake of the large personal fortunes the directors had invested in VOC shares), they decided to stop this attack on the company.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 公司的董事们并不知道勒梅尔参与其中，但他们知道有人在赌股价下跌，听到关于公司的传言，他们知道股价在下跌。VOC 是荷兰人的民族自豪感和国际力量的来源。为了国家的利益（也为了董事们在 VOC 股票上投资的大量个人财富），他们决定阻止对公司的这种攻击。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The directors appealed to lawmakers. They said there was a “dirty scheme” to bring down the price of shares and suggested foreign spies might be behind the whole thing. “The general enemy has its accomplices among the important sellers,” they wrote. In case a dirty scheme perpetrated by the general enemy wasn’t enough to get lawmakers’ attention, the directors added that the victims included “the many widows and orphans” who owned VOC shares.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">董事们向立法者发出呼吁。他们说有一个“肮脏的计划”来压低股价，并暗示外国间谍可能是整个事件的幕后黑手。他们写道：“一般的敌人在重要的卖家中都有其同伙。”如果大敌当前的肮脏计划还不足以引起立法者的注意，董事们补充说，受害者包括拥有 VOC 股票的“许多寡妇和孤儿”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the case of enemy spies (the people betting against the VOC) versus widows and orphans (the shareholders), the Dutch legislature did what every legislature in the history of the world would have done. It did something, anything, to make it look like it was on the side of widows and orphans. In February 1610, the lawmakers banned investors from promising to sell in the future any shares they did not possess in the present. Put another way, they made Le Maire’s scheme illegal.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在敌方间谍（与 VOC 对赌的人）与寡妇和孤儿（股东）的案件中，荷兰立法机构做了世界历史上所有立法机构都会做的事情。它做了一些事情，当然包括任何事情，以使它看起来像是站在寡妇和孤儿一边。1610 年 2 月，立法者禁止投资者承诺在未来出售他们目前不拥有的任何股份。换句话说，他们将勒梅尔的计划定为非法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The price of VOC stock started rising almost immediately. Several of Le Maire’s partners went bankrupt. Le Maire lost tons of money. His scheme failed. The directors got their happy ending.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">VOC 股票的价格几乎立即开始上涨。勒梅尔的几个合作伙伴破产了。勒梅尔损失了大量的钱。他的计划失败了。董事们得到了他们的幸福结局。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But! What if Team Le Maire was telling the truth about the VOC? What if there was a good reason for the share price to fall?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是！如果勒梅尔团队说的是关于 VOC 的真相呢？如果股价下跌的确有一个很好的理由呢？</p>

<p class="calibre9">When the government was trying to decide what to do about the people betting against the VOC, a group of share dealers (which  may have included Le Maire’s partners) argued that the share price was falling because the business wasn’t being run very well. It “is widely known and clear to everyone that many more ships are being sent than is necessary,” they wrote. Le Maire wrote a letter to a senior government official, adding up the cost of all the VOC ships that had run aground and disappeared. And those ships that did make it back were bringing too much of a spice called mace, and not enough other stuff. All that mace was sitting unsold in warehouses, deteriorating in quality. The people betting against the stock, according to Le Maire, were just investors “who engage in some buying and selling of shares… on the basis of the news and information that they receive on a daily basis.” The directors, Le Maire said, had bought “large portions of shares at a very high price.” They weren’t trying to ban shorts to protect widows and orphans. They were doing it to enrich themselves.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当政府试图决定如何处理押注 VOC 的人时，一群股票交易商（其中可能包括勒梅尔的合伙人）认为，股价下跌是因为企业经营得不是很好。他们写道：“众所周知，大家都很清楚，派出的船只比需要的多得多”，勒梅尔给一位高级政府官员写了一封信，把所有搁浅和消失的 VOC 船只的费用加起来。那些回来的船带来了太多的香料，叫做麦芽糖，而其他东西却不够。所有的麦芽糖都在仓库里没卖出去，质量越来越差。据勒梅尔说，押注股票的人只是投资者，“他们从事一些股票的买卖…… 根据他们每天收到的新闻和信息。”勒梅尔说，董事们“以非常高的价格购买了大量的股票”。他们并不是为了保护寡妇和孤儿而禁止做空。他们这样做是为了让自己发财。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Today, if the price of a stock suddenly starts falling, it’s routine for the CEO of the company to go on TV and say the people betting against the stock are spreading rumors. People’s retirements are invested in our company! Think of the widows and orphans! Everybody wants the market to go up; people betting stocks will fall seem like the bad guys.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">今天，如果一只股票的价格突然开始下跌，该公司的首席执行官上电视说押注该股票的人在散布谣言，这是惯例。人们的退休生活都投资在我们的公司里! 想想那些寡妇和孤儿吧! 每个人都希望市场上涨；押注股票将下跌的人似乎是坏人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But the point of the stock market is not to go up. The point of the stock market is to find the right price for stocks&mdash;the price that best reflects all available information about the performance of the company and the state of the world. Obviously, stock markets sometimes fail miserably at this task. But the more investors who are in the market&mdash;and, crucially, the more information they bring to the market&mdash;the better the market will be at finding the right price. Allowing people to profit when the price of a stock falls  creates an incentive for investors to root out fraud and spread bad news that might otherwise remain unnoticed. This is a good thing.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，股市的意义不在于上涨。股市的意义在于为股票找到合适的价格 —— 即最能反映公司业绩和世界状况的所有可用信息的价格。显然，股票市场有时会在这项任务上惨遭失败。但市场上的投资者越多，关键是他们给市场带来的信息越多，市场就越能找到正确的价格。允许人们在股票价格下跌时获利，会激励投资者铲除欺诈行为，并传播否则可能未被注意的坏消息。这是一件好事。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Isaac Le Maire kept arguing with the authorities over money he claimed he was owed. They never gave it to him. He died in a small town by the sea and was buried under a tombstone with this epitaph:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">伊萨克·勒梅尔一直在与当局争论他声称被欠的钱。他们从未给过他钱。他死在海边的一个小镇上，被埋在一块墓碑下，墓志铭是这样写的：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Here lies Isaac Le Maire, merchant, who, during his activities over all the parts of the world, by the grace of God, knew so much abundance that in thirty years he lost (save his honour) more than 150,000 florins.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">这里有商人艾萨克·勒梅尔，一个商人。他在世界各地的活动中，承蒙上帝的恩典，知道了很多丰富的东西，以至于在 30 年里他失去了（为他的荣誉）超过 15 万弗罗林。</p>
</div>

<p class="calibre9">This may be the only tombstone on Earth that brags about how much money the deceased lost. Also, it seems to be a typo. In a letter written before he died, Le Maire mentioned losing 1,600,000 florins. His epitaph is missing a zero.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这可能是地球上唯一一块吹嘘死者失去多少钱的墓碑。另外，这似乎是一个错字。在他死前写的一封信中，勒梅尔提到损失了 160 万弗罗林。他的墓志铭缺少一个零。</p>

</h1>

<p class="noindent">Even booming Amsterdam had its own version of the money problem. In this case, the problem was not a shortage of coins, like in Britain. It was too many different kinds of coins.</p>

<p class="noindent">即使是繁荣的阿姆斯特丹也有它自己版本的货币问题。在这种情况下，问题不在于像英国那样的硬币短缺。它是太多不同种类的硬币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Traders and merchants from all over Europe were doing business in Amsterdam. They often used written promises to pay, which were sort of like postdated checks, and were known as bills of exchange. But when it came time to settle a bill&mdash;to make payment in real silver and gold&mdash;things got messy. All these foreign traders had coins from different countries and kingdoms and city-states, so Amsterdam’s city government assigned official values to almost 1,000 different coins. There were counterfeits, and some coins had been shaved and didn’t weigh as much as they were supposed to. Sometimes traders literally had to haggle over every coin. This was a boon for money changers, and for hustlers, but it was a drag on honest merchants who just wanted to do business without worrying about every coin.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">来自欧洲各地的贸易者和商人在阿姆斯特丹做生意。他们经常使用书面付款承诺，这有点像过期支票，被称为汇票。但是，当到了结算票据的时候，用真正的金银来付款，事情就变得混乱了。所有这些外国商人都有来自不同国家、王国和城邦的硬币，因此阿姆斯特丹的市政府为近 1000 种不同的硬币指定了官方价值。有一些是假币，另外一些硬币被刮掉了，没有它们应该有的那么重。有时商人们不得不为每枚硬币讨价还价。这对货币兑换商和骗子来说是个福音，但对那些只想做生意而不担心每枚硬币的诚实商人来说却是个拖累。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So in 1609, just a few years after the VOC was created, the city of Amsterdam chartered a public bank&mdash;a bank owned not by money changers or investors, but by the city itself. The purpose of the bank was  not to make a profit, but to solve Amsterdam’s money problem. Along with the bank came a new law that said if you had bills of exchange coming due in Amsterdam, you had to go to the bank to settle up.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，在 1609 年，就在 VOC 成立的几年后，阿姆斯特丹市特许成立了一家公共银行 —— 这家银行不是由货币兑换商或投资者拥有，而是由城市本身拥有。该银行的目的不是为了盈利，而是为了解决阿姆斯特丹的资金问题。随着银行的成立，一项新的法律规定，如果你在阿姆斯特丹有汇票到期，你必须到银行去结算。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Merchants opened accounts at the bank. When a bill came due, they could pay it (or get paid) simply by having the bank transfer money out of (or into) their account by changing the numbers in the bank’s ledgers. They didn’t have to worry about all those different coins anymore, or about counterfeits. The account at the bank&mdash;the number on the bank’s ledger&mdash;was their money. And it worked better than coins.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">商人们在银行开了账户。当账单到期时，他们可以通过改变银行账簿中的数字，让银行将钱从他们的账户中转出（或转入），从而支付账单（或获得付款）。他们不必再担心所有这些不同的硬币，也不必担心假币。银行的账户和银行账簿上的数字就是他们的钱。而且它比硬币更好用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As John Law gambled his way through Europe, he saw Amsterdam getting rich because it had a bank that created reliable money for everyone to use, and a stock market where anyone could invest, and colonies on the other side of the world (like a lot of his European contemporaries, Law was apparently not troubled by the atrocities committed by the colonialists). At some point, John Law had a vision. He would stop wandering around Europe. He would go back to Scotland&mdash;not as a gambler or a convicted murderer, but as a hero bringing economic revolution.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当约翰·劳在欧洲赌博时，他看到阿姆斯特丹发了财，因为它有一个创造可靠货币供大家使用的银行，还有一个任何人都可以投资的股票市场，以及世界另一端的殖民地（像他同时代的很多欧洲人一样，劳显然没有被殖民者的暴行所困扰）。在某些时候，约翰·劳有一个设想。他将停止在欧洲徘徊。他将回到苏格兰 —— 不是作为一个赌徒或被定罪的杀人犯，而是作为一个带来经济革命的英雄。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the time Law went back to Scotland, he was in his early thirties and had been wandering around Europe for about a decade. He got home and started trying to convince his countrymen that they were screwing themselves with their rickety financial system where there was never enough money. In 1705, he published a 120-page pamphlet called “Money and Trade Considered, With a Proposal for Supplying the Nation With Money.” (His aunt was the publisher.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当罗回到苏格兰的时候，他已经三十出头，在欧洲游荡了大约十年。他回到家后，开始试图说服他的同胞们，说，你们正在用摇摇欲坠的金融体系搞垮自己，因为那里的钱永远不够用。1705 年，他出版了一本 120 页的小册子，名为《货币和贸易的考虑，以及为国家提供货币的建议》(他的姑姑是出版商)。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He pointed to the Dutch and said, there are all these reasons they should have a crappy country.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他指着荷兰人说，所有这些原因，使得他们就该有一个糟糕的国家。</p>

<p class="calibre9">
<em class="calibre4">Their natural Disadvantages are, smalness of Territory, barrenness of Soil… want of Mines; long Winters; unwholsome Air;… a dangerous Coast; difficult Entry to their Rivers; the Sea to defend against on one side, and powerful Neighbours on the other…</em></p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他们的天然缺点是：领土狭小，土壤贫瘠…… 没有矿井；冬季漫长；空气不稳定…… 海岸危险；难以进入他们的河流；一边是需要防御的大海，另一边是强大的邻国……</p>

<p class="calibre9">But despite all that, the Dutch prospered because they solved the money problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">尽管如此，荷兰人还是繁荣了起来，因为他们解决了钱的问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">
<em class="calibre4">… they are become a rich and powerful People.</em></p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">…… 他们（竟然）成为一个富有和强大的民族。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Scotland, Law continued, was in exactly the opposite situation.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳继续说，苏格兰的情况正好相反。</p>

<p class="calibre9">
<em class="calibre4">Scotland has by Nature many Advantages for Trade; a large Territory; of easie defence; plenty of People; a wholsome Air; Mines… ; a safe Coast; Rivers of easie Entry; the Seas and Rivers stockt with Fish.…</em></p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">苏格兰在自然界中具有许多贸易优势；领土辽阔；易于防御；人口众多；空气清新；有矿…… 海岸安全；河流易于进入；海洋和河流都有鱼……</p>

<p class="calibre9">Scotland just had to solve its money problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">苏格兰只需解决其资金问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Scotland needed to create more money. The creation of money would make it cheaper for people to borrow and invest, and it would create jobs for the unemployed. This is basic, uncontroversial monetary policy today; back then it was the moon. To create more money, he continued, Scotland needed to get over its outdated ideas and create a government-chartered bank, like the one in Amsterdam. But Scotland should go further. The new bank, Law argued, should print paper money that was backed not by silver or gold, but by land. That way, Scotland could have a lot more money, even without getting more gold or silver.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">苏格兰需要创造更多的货币。创造货币将使人们的借贷和投资更加便宜，并为失业者创造就业机会。这在今天是基本的、没有争议的货币政策；在当时，这就是痴心妄想。他继续说，为了创造更多的货币，苏格兰需要克服其过时的想法，创建一个政府特许的银行，就像在阿姆斯特丹的银行一样。但苏格兰应该走得更远。罗认为，新的银行应该印刷纸币，这些纸币不是由白银或黄金支持，而是由土地支持。这样一来，即使没有得到更多的黄金或白银，苏格兰也可以拥有更多的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Scotland’s parliament debated whether to take Law’s advice. The head of one party called Law’s ideas “a contrivance to enslave the nation.” An earl from an opposing party defended the ideas. The party head challenged the earl to a duel (always with the duel). The men met on the edge of town; excuses ensued; pistols were fired into the air. The duel was over, and no one was hurt, but Law’s chance of changing Scotland was dead. Not long after, it became clear that Scotland and England were about to unite into Great Britain, and John Law, still wanted for murder in England, had to go back on the lam.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">苏格兰议会就是否采纳罗的建议进行了辩论。一个政党的领袖称劳的想法是“奴役国家的计谋”。一位来自反对党的伯爵为这些观点辩护。该党派负责人向伯爵提出了决斗的挑战（总是要决斗）。两人在城边相遇；随后发生了争执；手枪被射向空中。决斗结束了，没有人受伤，但劳的改变苏格兰的机会已经丧失。不久之后，苏格兰和英格兰显然即将统一为大不列颠，而约翰·劳仍因当年的谋杀罪在英格兰被通缉，不得不重新开始逃亡。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Again he wandered through Europe. But this time, instead of  just gambling, he was dreaming of solving the money problems of an entire nation&mdash;any nation would do. He pitched his ideas to the Austrian emperor, who didn’t bite (though Law apparently did well at the gambling tables of Vienna). He tried and failed to sell the Duke of Savoy on a Bank of Turin. In 1714, Law moved to Paris, where he struck local officials as sketchy. The chief of police warned the foreign minister:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他又一次在欧洲游荡。但这一次，他不再只是赌博，而是梦想着解决整个国家的金钱问题 —— 任何国家都可以。他向奥地利皇帝提出了他的想法，但皇帝没有上钩（尽管劳显然在维也纳的赌桌上表现不错）。他试图向萨瓦公爵推销都灵银行，但没有成功。1714 年，罗搬到了巴黎，在那里他给当地官员留下了简陋的印象。警察局长警告外交部长：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">A Scot named Law, gambler by profession and suspected of evil intentions towards the King, appears at Paris in high style and has even bought an impressive home… although no one knows of any resource except fortune in gambling, which is his whole profession.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">一个名叫劳的苏格兰人，职业是赌徒，被怀疑对国王有不良企图，在巴黎高调出现，甚至买了一个特别好的房子…… 尽管没有人知道他有什么资源，除了赌博的财富，这是他的全部职业。</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">But in Paris Law finally caught a break. In the margin of the letter, the foreign minister wrote of Law: “He is not suspect. He may be left in peace.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在巴黎，劳终于抓住了一个突破口。在信的空白处，外交部长这样写道：“他没有嫌疑。他可以平静地离开。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">By this time, Law had a common-law wife (who had never formally divorced her first husband, nor married Law, but whatever, it’s France) and two kids. He was super rich (he kept a lot of his money in the Bank of Amsterdam) and bought a mansion on a fashionable square in Paris where the Ritz Hotel stands today. He had a collection of paintings by Italian masters and what the suspicious police chief described as a “sizeable retinue of servants.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这时，劳有一个实际上的妻子（她从未正式与第一任丈夫离婚，也未与劳结婚，但不管怎样，这是法国）和两个孩子。他超级有钱（他把很多钱都存在阿姆斯特丹银行），并在巴黎一个时尚的广场上买了一栋豪宅，今天的丽兹酒店就在那里。他收藏了很多意大利大师的画作，还有可疑的警察局长所说的“相当规模的仆人随从”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Maybe most important, Law had become good friends with the Duke of Orléans, a debauched French nobleman who was about to become very important. The Duke’s hobbies included working in his home chemistry lab, composing operas, and staying up all night with nobles and opera singers and actresses who got drunk, slept with each other, and “said vile things at the tops of their voices.” The Duke’s big moment came in September 1715, when King Louis the XIV died.  The heir, Louis XV, was five years old. Orléans was appointed Regent, which meant he got to rule France until the boy king came of age.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">也许最重要的是，罗与奥尔良公爵成了好朋友，他是一个放荡的法国贵族，这即将变得非常重要。公爵的爱好包括在他的家庭化学实验室工作，创作歌剧，与贵族和歌剧演员通宵达旦，他们喝醉了，就一起睡觉，并“用他们的声音说着卑鄙的话”。公爵的重要时刻是在 1715 年 9 月，当时国王路易十四去世。随后的继承人，路易十五，当时只有五岁。奥尔良被任命为摄政王，这意味着他可以统治法国，直到小国王长大成人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He took over a bankrupt country. The previous king&mdash;which is to say the French government&mdash;had borrowed everywhere he could, mostly to fund a never-ending series of wars. He’d forced people to turn in their silver coins to be re-minted for a fee. People responded by hoarding their coins or by smuggling them out of the country to somewhere safer, like Amsterdam. At one point the king got so desperate he melted down his own silver furniture to turn it into coins. Then he borrowed some more, promising his lenders that they could keep all of the country’s tax revenues for years to come.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他接管了一个破产的国家。前任国王 —— 也就是法国政府 —— 到处借钱，主要用于资助一系列无休止的战争。他强迫人们交出他们的银币，以便有偿重新铸造。人们的反应是应该自己囤积的硬币，或者把它们偷运出国到更安全的地方，如阿姆斯特丹。有一次，国王变得如此绝望，他把自己的银质家具熔化成硬币。然后他又借了一些钱，向贷款人承诺，他们可以在未来几年内保留国家的所有税收。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Everyone in France with money to loan had loaned to the government. When the government didn’t pay them back, they couldn’t pay their own debts. By the end of Louis XIV’s reign, the economy had collapsed entirely. “The shortage of credit was universal, trade was destroyed, consumption was cut by half, the cultivation of lands neglected, the people unhappy,” a minister wrote.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">法国所有有钱的人都借给了政府。当政府没有偿还他们时，他们就无法偿还自己的债务。到路易十四统治的末期，经济完全崩溃了。一位大臣写道：“信贷短缺是普遍现象，贸易被破坏了，消费减少了一半，土地的耕种被忽视了，人民不高兴了。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law was forty-four years old. He’d been pitching his ideas about money for a decade. Finally, with his buddy as the Regent, he was about to get his big chance.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳今年四十四岁了。十年来，他一直在提出自己关于金钱的想法。最后，在他的伙伴担任执政官的情况下，他即将得到他的大好机会。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-147" class="sect1">It’s Money If Everyone Believes It’s Money 如果人人都相信它是钱，它就是钱</h1>

<p class="noindent">During the twenty years John Law had been on the lam, England, the former financial backwater, had leapt ahead of every other country in Europe by solving the problem the king of France and, really, every king and every government has always faced: how to raise money.</p>

<p class="noindent">在约翰·劳在逃的 20 年里，英国这个曾经的金融落后地区，通过解决一个长期面临的问题，已经领先于欧洲其他国家 —— 而这个问题是法国国王，实际上是每个国王和每个政府一直面临的问题：如何筹集资金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Governments did then what governments do now&mdash;they taxed  people, and they borrowed. But Europe’s monarchies tended to tax and borrow in a sort of random, ad hoc way. One year, the king would have a big, one-off lottery. (Like a tax, but more fun!) The next, maybe sell a few annuities and borrow from the rich. Maybe he’d pay them back, maybe he wouldn’t.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时的政府和现在的政府一样，他们向人民征税，并且借贷。但欧洲的君主国倾向于以一种随机的、临时的方式来征税和借贷。有一年，国王会举行一次大型的、一次性的彩票活动。(就像征税一样，但更有趣！）下一年，也许会出售一些年金并向富人借款。也许他会偿还他们，也许他不会。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1694, the English tried to solve the government money problem in a new way. They had just gone through a revolution in which Parliament demanded limits on the power of the monarch. Now Parliament and the newly installed king and queen took all of these new money technologies that were starting to take off&mdash;banks and stocks and paper money&mdash;and created a new kind of bank. They called it the Bank of England.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1694 年，英国人试图以一种新的方式解决政府的货币问题。他们刚刚经历了一场革命，议会要求对君主的权力进行限制。现在，议会和新上任的国王和王后开始利用所有这些开始起飞的新货币技术，银行、股票和纸币，并创建了一种新的银行。他们称之为英格兰银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The first thing the bank did was sell shares to raise £1.2 million from investors. These people weren’t depositing money in the bank. They were buying shares as an investment, the same way you can buy stock in Bank of America or Wells Fargo on the New York Stock Exchange today.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行做的第一件事是出售股票，从投资者那里筹集 120 万英镑。这些人并不是把钱存入银行。他们购买股票作为投资，就像你今天在纽约证券交易所购买美国银行或富国银行的股票一样。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As with the Dutch East India Company (the VOC), which was now nearly one hundred years old, anybody who wanted to could invest. And everybody wanted to invest. Merchants and farmers and sailors and vicars all got in on it. The king and queen kicked in £10,000, which was the maximum allowed. Eleven days after the bank started accepting investments, it had raised the £1.2 million. The last investor was one Judith Shirley, of Sussex, who put in £75.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就像现在已有近百年历史的荷兰东印度公司（VOC）一样，任何想投资的人都可以投资。而且每个人都想投资。商人、农民、水手和牧师都参与其中。国王和王后投入了 1 万英镑，这是允许的最高限额。在银行开始接受投资的 11 天后，它已经筹集到了 120 万英镑。最后一位投资者是苏塞克斯的朱迪斯·雪莉，她投入了 75 英镑。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The bank, in turn, loaned that £1.2 million to the king, who promised to pay 8 percent a year interest. And that wasn’t just the king saying he was good for it. The same act of Parliament that created the bank also created a special, new tax on shipping that the government was legally required to use to pay the interest on the loan.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行又将这 120 万英镑借给了国王，国王承诺每年支付 8% 的利息。而且，这不仅仅是国王自己大发善心。创建该银行的同一部议会法案还设立了一项特殊的、新的航运税，政府在法律上必须用它来支付贷款利息。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The bank’s loan to the king was not in the form of gold and  silver coins. The bank gave the king paper notes redeemable for gold and silver at the bank. The king used the money to fund a war.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行给国王的贷款不是以金银币的形式。银行给了国王可在银行兑换金银的纸币。国王用这笔钱来资助一场战争。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Bank of England was a huge success. It created a new, safe way for ordinary people to trade some money now for the possibility of more money later. They could lend, through the bank, to the government, in a regular, predictable way, and the law promised they’d be paid back. And because the bank was lending out more money than it had in the vaults, it created more money for England as a whole, in a way that was much more stable and reliable than a few random goldsmiths giving people claim checks.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">英格兰银行是一个巨大的成功。它创造了一种新的、安全的方式，让普通人现在用一些钱换取以后可能得到的更多钱。他们可以通过银行，以一种定期的、可预测的方式向政府贷款，法律承诺他们会得到回报。由于银行借出的钱比它在金库里的钱要多，它为整个英国创造了更多的钱，这种方式比随机的几个金匠给人们的索赔支票要稳定和可靠得多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By 1715, John Law had cooked up a plan to take what the Bank of England had done and push it much, much further.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到 1715 年，约翰·劳已经制定了一个计划，将英格兰银行所做的事情推得更远、更远。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When Law closed his eyes, he could see a whole financial system that linked together all of the hot new things&mdash;a bank, a stock market, a trading company, a new way for the government to get money. In a letter to the Duke of Orléans, who now ruled France as Regent, Law described the system with characteristic modesty:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当劳闭上眼睛时，他可以看到一个完整的金融系统，它将所有热门的新事物联系在一起 —— 一个银行、一个股票市场、一个贸易公司、一个政府获取资金的新途径。在写给现在以摄政王身份统治法国的奥尔良公爵的信中，劳以特有的谦虚描述了这个系统：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">But the bank is not the only nor the greatest of my ideas. I will produce a work that will surprise Europe by the changes it will bring in France’s favor, greater changes than those brought by the discovery of the Indies or by the introduction of credit. By this work Your Royal Highness will be in a position to relieve the kingdom of the sad condition into which it has fallen, and to make it more powerful than it has ever been…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">但银行并不是我唯一也是最伟大的想法。我将完成一项工作，它将使欧洲感到惊讶，因为它将为法国带来变化，比发现印度洋或引进信贷带来的变化更大。通过这项工作，殿下将能够使王国摆脱它所陷入的悲惨状况，并使它比以往任何时候都更加强大。</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">Law persuaded the Regent to let him start the first full-fledged bank in France. It had a big name&mdash;the Banque Générale&mdash;but it was so small that it was based in Law’s house. Like the Bank of England, Law’s bank raised money by selling stock to investors. Unlike the Bank of England, almost nobody wanted in. The French  establishment made fun of Law’s little bank. One writer called it “a vision… one can only laugh at it, no one believes it will last.” Both John Law and the institution of banking seemed weird and foreign and generally untrustworthy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳说服摄政王让他在法国创办第一家成熟的银行。这家银行有一个很大的名字，叫“通用银行”（Banque Générale），但规模很小，就在劳的房子里办公。与英格兰银行一样，劳的银行通过向投资者出售股票来筹集资金。与英格兰银行不同，几乎没有人想加入。法国的机构取笑罗的小银行。一位作家称其为“一个愿景…… 人们只能嘲笑它，没有人相信它能持续下去。”约翰·劳和银行机构都显得很奇怪，很陌生，一般来说是不值得信任的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But Law believed. He believed so hard he bought a quarter of the shares in the bank. Perhaps more important, Law’s old drinking buddy Orléans, who happened to be running France, also believed. And in the summer of 1716, Orléans sent chests full of gold from the Royal Mint to the Banque Générale&mdash;and made sure everybody knew about it. A Paris magazine described “an order the other day from the mint to send a million to M. Law’s bank, that the Regent supports and is really his bank under the name of this Englishman. Everyone believes that it will hold up because royal funds are going in to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但劳有信心。他太自信了，乃至于买下了银行四分之一的股份。也许更重要的是，劳的老酒友奥尔良（Orléans）碰巧在管理法国，他也信。1716 年夏天，奥尔良将一箱箱黄金从皇家铸币厂送到了通用银行，并确保所有人都知道这件事。一家巴黎杂志描述道：“前几天，铸币厂下达了向劳先生的银行汇款 100 万的命令，该银行得到摄政王的支持，实际上是他以这个英国人的名义开设的银行。每个人都相信它将会维持下去，因为皇室的资金正在进入该银行。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">Remember the first seven words of that last sentence: “Everyone believes that it will hold up.” They are the essence of banking (and, for that matter, of money). If everyone believes a bank will hold up, it will almost certainly hold up. If, on the other hand, people think a bank is going to fail, it will fail&mdash;even if its finances are in great shape.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">请记住最后一句话的前半句。“每个人都相信它能维持下去”。它们是银行业务（以及金钱）的本质。如果每个人都相信一家银行会维持下去，它几乎肯定会维持下去。另一方面，如果人们认为一家银行会倒闭，它就会倒闭，即使其财务状况很好。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Duke’s big deposit ensured Law’s bank’s survival. The bank’s big break came the next year, in 1717, when the Regent made a new rule that forced everyone in Paris and the surrounding areas to use paper notes issued by the bank to pay their taxes.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">公爵的大笔存款确保了劳的通用银行的生存。银行的重大突破出现在第二年，即 1717 年，摄政王制定了一项新规定，迫使巴黎和周边地区的所有人使用银行发行的纸币来支付税款。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A pretty good working definition of money is: it’s the thing you pay taxes with. In a world where different things are competing to be money&mdash;bills of exchange, silver and gold coins, notes from private banks&mdash;the thing the government accepts for taxes is going to win. It’s going to become money. That’s what happened in Paris in 1717. When the Regent forced people to use paper to pay their taxes, John Law’s paper became money. Now that Law’s paper was money, he was ready to go big.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">货币的一个很好的工作定义是：它是你用来交税的东西。在这个世界上，不同的东西都在争相成为货币，汇票、金银币、私人银行的票据，而政府接受的纳税的东西将获胜。它将成为货币。这就是 1717 年在巴黎发生的事情。当摄政王强迫人们用纸来交税时，约翰·劳的纸就成了钱。现在，劳的纸已经成了钱，他准备大干一场。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-22">The Invention of Millionaires 百万富翁的诞生</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">By the early eighteenth century, the Netherlands and England and Spain and Portugal had been sailing around the world for hundreds of years, looting and pillaging and harvesting cinnamon and getting rich. Starting in the sixteenth century, the French launched a series of expeditions to North America and managed to claim a good-sized chunk of present-day Canada and roughly half of the continental United States in a territory centered on the Mississippi River. (The French, of course, didn’t ask permission from the Native Americans who had lived there for thousands of years.)</p>

<p class="noindent">到了十八世纪初，荷兰、英国、西班牙和葡萄牙已经在世界各地航行了数百年，抢劫、掠夺、收获肉桂并发了财。从十六世纪开始，法国人向北美发起了一系列远征，并设法在以密西西比河为中心的领土上获得了有今天加拿大那么大的一块土地，相当于美国大陆的大约一半。(当然，法国人并没有征得在那里生活了几千年的美国原住民的同意）</p>

<p class="calibre9">Right around the time the Regent made everybody in Paris start using Law’s banknotes to pay their taxes, he also agreed to charter a second endeavor of Law’s. It was officially called the Company of the West, but everybody called it the Mississippi Company. The French government granted the company a monopoly on all of France’s trade along the Mississippi River. It was going to be like the Dutch East India Company (the VOC), only better.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就在摄政王让巴黎的每个人都开始使用劳的纸币来缴税的时候，他也将同意特许劳的第二次努力。它被正式称为西部公司，但大家都叫它密西西比公司。法国政府授权该公司垄断法国在密西西比河沿岸的所有贸易。它将会像荷兰东印度公司（VOC）一样，只是更出色。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law promised that the Mississippi Company was going to help the Regent deal with all that debt the previous king had run up.  The debt was in the form of bonds: rich French people had loaned the king money, and in exchange they had received the king’s promise that he would repay them the loan, plus 4 percent interest a year. But those interest payments had become a burden. So Law would allow French investors to trade in their bonds for shares in the Mississippi Company. Then the company would collect the debt from the king, but at a lower rate of interest over a longer period of time. This would reduce the interest payments for the government but still provide a stream of income for Law’s company.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳承诺，密西西比公司将帮助摄政王处理前任国王所欠下的所有债务。这些债务是以债券的形式存在的：富有的法国人借钱给国王，作为交换，他们得到了国王的承诺，即他将向他们偿还贷款，外加每年 4% 的利息。但这些利息支付已经成为一种负担。因此，劳将允许法国投资者用他们的债券换取密西西比公司的股份。然后，该公司将向国王收取债务，但在较长的时间内以较低的利率收取。这将减少政府的利息支出，但仍为劳的公司提供收入来源。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law made his pitch to the wealthy bondholders. What would you rather have, he asked them, unreliable payments of 4 percent interest from a dodgy boy-king or all the riches in the New World?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳向富有的债券持有人进行了推销。他问他们，你们愿意拥有什么，是来自一个可疑的国王小朋友的不靠谱的 4% 的利息付款，还是新世界的所有财富？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The French chose 4 percent interest. As with Law’s bank, almost nobody wanted in on his trading company. So, once again, Law and the Duke of Orléans poured in their own money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">法国人选择了 4% 的利息。与劳的银行一样，几乎没有人想加入他的贸易公司。因此，劳和奥尔良公爵再次投入了他们自己的资金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Slowly, though, things started happening. In the spring of 1718, a colonist working for the company founded a new capital, near the mouth of the Mississippi River. He wanted to flatter the Regent, so he named the capital after him: New Orleans.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">不过，事情慢慢地开始发生。1718 年春天，一位为该公司工作的殖民者在密西西比河口附近建立了一个新的都市。他想讨好摄政王，所以他以摄政王的名字为都市命名 —— 新奥尔良。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Back in France, Law’s persistence was finally beginning to pay off. People found that they liked using Law’s paper money&mdash;it was, in fact, easier to use than gold or silver. Within a few years, the bank had several branches around the country, which allowed people to move money from town to town simply by going to their local bank branch and requesting a transfer. And by making loans and creating money, Law’s bank did seem to be giving the French economy a useful boost. The basic business of growing food and making stuff started working again in France.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在法国，劳的坚持终于开始有了回报。人们发现，他们喜欢使用劳的纸币，事实上，它比黄金或白银更容易使用。在几年内，银行在全国各地有了几个分支机构，这使得人们只需到当地的银行分支机构申请转账，就可以在各个城市之间转移资金。而通过发放贷款和创造货币，劳的银行似乎确实给法国经济带来了有益的推动。种植粮食和制造东西的基本业务在法国又开始运作了。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-153" class="sect1"> “The Talk Was All of Millions”</h1>
<p class="noindent">In December 1718, Law’s bank became the Banque Royale&mdash;the Royal Bank. It was now controlled entirely by the king (which is to say, by Law’s pal Orléans). The new charter said the bank could print as much paper money as the king allowed. It also formally linked the ownership of the bank and the Mississippi Company. More paper money would lead to more trade, which would make everybody better off. The bank and the company would support each other, and all of France (and of course John Law) would be richer for it.</p>

<p class="noindent">1718 年 12 月，劳的银行成为“皇家银行”（Banque Royale — the Royal Bank）。它现在完全由国王（也就是说，由劳的伙伴奥尔良）控制。新的章程规定，银行可以在国王允许的范围内印刷大量纸币。它还将银行和密西西比公司的所有权正式联系起来。更多的纸币将导致更多的贸易，这将使每个人都过得更好。银行和公司将相互支持，而整个法国（当然还有约翰·劳）将因此而更加富有。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Things started happening fast. In the next few months, Law merged the Mississippi Company with other French companies that were supposed to be trading with Asia and Africa but hadn’t really been doing much. Law also acquired the right to trade tobacco in France. (“They call it the magic plant, because those who begin to use it can no longer give it up,” the Regent’s mother, Princess Palatine, said.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">事情开始加速。在接下来的几个月里，罗将密西西比公司与其他法国公司合并，这些公司本应与亚洲和非洲进行贸易，但并没有真正做什么。劳还获得了在法国进行烟草贸易的权利。(“他们称它为神奇的植物，因为那些开始使用它的人再也无法放弃它了”，摄政王的母亲帕拉丁公主说。) </p>

<p class="calibre9">To pay for these acquisitions, Law planned to sell new shares in the Mississippi Company. People saw that the company was growing, and they had money in their pockets&mdash;money that Law’s bank was printing. Everybody wanted to buy shares. Here Law made a genius move. He said: you can’t buy the new shares unless you already own the old shares. So everybody rushed to buy the old shares, and the price started shooting up.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">为了支付这些收购，劳计划出售密西西比公司的新股票。人们看到公司正在成长，而且他们的口袋里有钱 —— 劳的银行正在印刷的钱。每个人都想买股票。在这里，劳做了一个天才的举动。他说：除非你已经拥有旧股票，否则你不能购买新股票。因此，每个人都急于购买旧股，而价格开始飙升。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few weeks later, the Company bought the rights to all the profits from the Royal Mint for the next nine years. Law financed that with another generation of shares&mdash;and to buy shares this time, you had to own both of the previous generations of shares. The share price went up some more.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几周后，公司买下了皇家铸币厂未来 9 年的所有利润权。劳用另一代股票为其融资 —— 而这次购买股票，你必须同时拥有前几代的股票。股价又上涨了一些。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> By August 1719, shares were trading for more than 3,000 livres each, up from around 500 a few months earlier. Around this time, Law made his biggest move yet. He offered to lend the king enough money to pay off the entire national debt of France. He was basically offering to consolidate the king’s loans: take all of these different loans, bundle them all together, and lower the interest rate the king had to pay. The king&mdash;in the person of the Regent&mdash;accepted Law’s offer. To raise the money, Law sold more stock.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到 1719 年 8 月，股票的交易价格超过了 3000 里弗，比几个月前的 500 里弗要高。大约在这个时候，劳做出了他最大的行动。他提出要借给国王足够的钱来偿还法国的全部国债。他基本上是提出要合并国王的贷款：把所有这些不同的贷款，捆绑在一起，并降低国王必须支付的利息。国王以摄政王的名义接受了劳的提议。为了筹集资金，劳出售了更多的股票。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People knew the price was only going to go up after the stock hit the open market, so they went straight to Law to try to get stock directly from him. “Law was continually besieged by suppliants and flatterers; his door was forced, people entered by the windows from his garden, and fell down the chimney into his study,” a nobleman wrote at the time. “The talk was all of millions.” The word <em class="calibre4">millionaire</em> was invented to describe the people who were getting rich off their Mississippi Company stock.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们知道股票进入公开市场后价格只会上涨，所以他们直接去找劳，试图直接从他那里获得股票。一个贵族当时写道：“劳不断地被支持者和奉承者围攻；他的门被强行打开，人们从他的花园的窗户进入，并从烟囱掉进他的书房。”人们谈论的都是数以百万计的事情。“百万富翁”这个词是为了描述那些靠密西西比公司股票发财的人而发明的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law kept swallowing up more and more of the business of the French state. Eventually, inevitably, the Regent granted Law the right to collect taxes on behalf of the king. The French had special taxes on every little thing people bought. Law replaced those with a single income tax, which was more efficient and less of a burden for the poor. “The people went dancing and jumping about the street, as if they were distracted for joy,” Daniel Defoe wrote from Paris that fall. “They now pay not one farthing tax for wood, coal, hay, oats, oil, wine, beer, bread, cards, soap, cattle, fish, or, in a word, for anything.…”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳不断吞噬着法国国家越来越多的业务。最终，不可避免地，摄政王授予劳代表国王收税的权利。法国人对人们购买的每件小东西都征收特别税。劳用单一的收入税取代了这些税，这样做效率更高，对穷人的负担更小。“那年秋天”，丹尼尔·笛福（Daniel Defoe）在巴黎写道：“人们在大街上跳舞、跳跃，仿佛他们因喜悦而心烦意乱。他们现在没有为木材、煤炭、干草、燕麦、石油、葡萄酒、啤酒、面包、卡片、肥皂、牛、鱼，或者，总之，为任何东西支付一毛钱的税金……”</p>

<p class="calibre9">France boomed. Money was everywhere. In the countryside, farmers started growing food on land that had lain fallow. In Paris, artisans sold more lace, and plates, and clothes than ever. The government hired workers to build roads and bridges. French soldiers  were off fighting Spain&mdash;they were always off fighting somebody&mdash;but this time, the government could pay them without melting down the king’s silverware.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">法国繁荣了。到处都是钱。在农村，农民开始在休耕的土地上种植粮食。在巴黎，工匠们卖出了比以往更多的蕾丝、盘子和衣服。政府雇用工人修建道路和桥梁。法国士兵在与西班牙作战，他们总是在与人作战，但这次，政府可以支付他们的工资，而不用融化国王的银器。</p>

<p class="calibre9">John Law was, increasingly, the French economy. He collected taxes for the government and received the government’s payment on the national debt. He had a monopoly on all of France’s trade outside Europe. And he could literally print money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">约翰·劳越来越多地成为法国的经济支柱。他为政府收税，并接受政府对国债的支付。他垄断了法国在欧洲以外的所有贸易。而且，他可以真正地印钞票。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Mississippi Company stock kept rising. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over Europe came to Paris to get in on the action. They crowded around the company’s office to get the latest news, and to buy and sell shares. Carriages couldn’t get through, so city officials closed the street to traffic and put iron gates on either end. Every day at 7 a.m. they rang a bell and banged a drum and opened the gates, and everyone rushed in to buy and sell stock. A clerk at the British embassy wrote that the street “is crowded from early in the morning to late at night with princes and princesses, dukes and peers and duchesses etc. in a word all that is great in France. They sell estates and pawn jewels to purchase Mississippi.” Law’s footman (the guy who rides on the back of the carriage) got so rich on Company stock that he quit his job and hired two footmen&mdash;one for himself and one for Law. In early December, shares hit 10,000.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">密西西比公司的股票不断上涨。来自欧洲各地的几十万人来到巴黎，想参与到这一行动中。他们拥挤在公司的办公室周围，以获得最新的消息，并购买和出售股票。马车无法通过，因此市政府官员关闭了街道，在两端设置了铁门。每天早上 7 点，他们敲钟打鼓，打开大门，所有人都冲进去买卖股票。英国大使馆的一名职员写道，这条街“从清晨到深夜都挤满了王子和公主、公爵、贵族和公爵夫人等等，总之是法国所有伟大的东西。他们卖掉房产，当掉珠宝来购买密西西比河。”劳的脚夫（骑在马车后面的人）在公司股票上发了大财，以至于他辞掉了工作，雇了两个脚夫，一个给自己，一个给劳。12 月初，股价达到 10,000 美元。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The shares of the Company Law bought when no one wanted them now made him, a man on the run from a murder charge in England, the wealthiest non-royal in Europe. He bought a dozen country estates, several mansions in Paris, a bunch of diamonds, and 45,000 books.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳在无人问津时买下的公司股份，现在使他这个在英国因谋杀指控而逃亡的人成为欧洲最富有的非皇室成员。他买了十几个乡间庄园，在巴黎的几个豪宅，一堆钻石和 45,000 本书。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In January 1720, Law was appointed Controller-General of Finances for all of France&mdash;the second most powerful job in the country after the Regent. The job gave John Law very high status,  which paired nicely with all that wealth. The government thanked him for “the important services that you have rendered to our State as much for the establishment of our Royal Bank, whose utility we appreciate, as for the different arrangements that have been made for the payment of our public debts, for the increase in our state revenues and the relief of our people.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1720 年 1 月，劳被任命为全法国的财政总管 —— 这是该国仅次于摄政王的第二大权力职位。这份工作给了约翰·劳很高的地位，这与所有的财富相得益彰。政府感谢他：“你为我们国家提供了重要的服务，就像建立我们的皇家银行一样，我们很欣赏它的效用，以及为支付我们的公共债务、增加我们的国家收入和救济我们的人民而做出的不同安排。”</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-158" class="sect1">The Real Economy Versus the Mississippi Bubble</h1>
<p class="noindent">A share in the Mississippi Company, just like a share of Apple, or GM, or any other corporation today, entitled its owner to a share of all the company’s future profits, forever. The run-up in the Mississippi Company’s share price between 1719 and 1720 was based on the promise of vast future profits. This seemed plausible enough. The Spanish had discovered a mountain full of silver in South America, and the Dutch grew rich controlling remote islands full of cinnamon and cloves. There were stories in France of the great riches of the Mississippi territory: an emerald mountain, vast silver deposits, hundreds of prosperous houses springing up in New Orleans.</p>

<p class="noindent">密西西比公司的股份，就像今天的苹果公司、通用汽车或任何其他公司的股份一样，其所有者有权永远分享公司的所有未来利润。密西西比公司的股价在 1719 年至 1720 年间的上涨是基于对未来巨大利润的承诺。这似乎很有道理。西班牙人在南美洲发现了一座充满银子的山，荷兰人在控制充满肉桂和丁香的偏远岛屿上发了财。在法国，有关于密西西比地区巨大财富的故事：一座绿宝石山、大量的银矿、新奥尔良出现的数百座繁荣的房屋。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In fact, there were no emeralds or silver. By 1719, French settlers had built a total of four houses in New Orleans. But Law seems to have really believed there was potential for something great. The company bought dozens of ships, and Law invested his own money to send settlers to an area west of the Mississippi, in what is now Arkansas, to grow tobacco and look for silver. Most of them died of disease and starvation, which was what usually happened when Europeans went there. People from around Europe flocked to Paris  to get rich trading Mississippi Company stock; they did not flock to Mississippi. So Law pushed through new laws for transporting army deserters, prostitutes, and criminals to America, and in 1719 ships of unwilling settlers started sailing across the Atlantic. It was a desperation move; things weren’t going well.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">事实上，当时并没有翡翠或白银。到 1719 年，法国定居者在新奥尔良总共建造了四座房子。但是，劳似乎真的相信这里有巨大的潜力。公司买了几十艘船，而劳则用自己的钱把定居者送到密西西比河以西的一个地区，也就是现在的阿肯色州，种植烟草和寻找银。他们中的大多数人都死于疾病和饥饿，这就是欧洲人去那里时通常发生的情况。欧洲各地的人涌向巴黎，交易密西西比公司的股票发财；他们并没有涌向密西西比州。因此，劳推动通过了将军队逃兵、妓女和罪犯运送到美国的新法律，1719 年，不情愿的定居者的船只开始驶过大西洋。这是一个无奈之举；事情进展得并不顺利。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In March 1720, John Law made a shocking announcement&mdash;one that would ultimately doom his whole project. He said the Mississippi Company would buy or sell unlimited quantities of company stock at the fixed price of 9,000 livres, just below where the stock was trading on the open market. It seems like he wanted to stop the run-up in prices and stabilize the market. What ended up happening was lots of people sold their stock back to the company. And the bank (now owned by the company) printed more paper money to buy all the stock.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1720 年 3 月，约翰·劳发表了一个令人震惊的声明，这个声明最终将使他的整个项目夭折。他说，密西西比公司将以 9,000 利弗尔的固定价格购买或出售无限量的公司股票，该价格刚好低于股票在公开市场上的交易价格。他似乎想阻止价格的上涨，稳定市场。最后发生的事情是很多人把他们的股票卖回给公司。而银行（现在由该公司拥有）印制了更多的纸币来购买所有的股票。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Economists have this odd phrase: “the real economy.” It means, roughly, all economic activity that happens outside of finance. The carpenter who builds your house works in the real economy. The banker who lends you money to buy the house does not. When an economy is working well, the real economy and finance support each other. The banker gives you a loan so you can buy the house the carpenter built. Everyone (theoretically) wins.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">经济学家有一个奇怪的说法：“实体经济”。它的意思大致是指发生在金融之外的所有经济活动。为你建造房屋的木匠在实体经济中工作。而借钱给你买房子的银行家则不是。当一个经济运行良好时，实体经济和金融就会相互支持。银行家给你贷款，你就可以买到木匠建造的房子。每个人（理论上）都是赢家。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But there are times when the real economy and finance become disconnected. Sometimes, finance lags behind the real economy. There’s not enough money, or loans, to go around, and nobody wants to invest in anything. That was France before John Law got there. (The Great Depression is the classic example from the modern era.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，有时实体经济和金融会脱节。有时，金融落后于实体经济。没有足够的钱或贷款，没有人愿意投资于任何东西。在约翰·劳到达法国之前，法国的情况就是如此。(大萧条是现代的典型例子。)</p>

<p class="calibre9">At other times, finance races out ahead of the real economy. There’s too much money floating around, it’s too easy to get a loan, and everybody wants to invest. People start buying not because they  want a future stream of income from their investments, but because they speculate they can turn around and sell for more in a day or a month. That was France in 1720&mdash;and it was turning into a problem for the real economy. All that new money floating around was driving up the price of basic staples like wheat, candles, and milk. From the fall of 1719 to the fall of 1720, prices nearly doubled.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在其他时候，金融比实体经济领先。有太多的钱在漂浮，获得贷款太容易了，每个人都想投资。人们开始购买，不是因为他们想从他们的投资中获得未来的收入，而是因为他们猜测他们可以在一天或一个月内转身并以更高的价格出售。这就是 1720 年的法国，而且它正在变成实体经济的一个问题。所有这些四处漂浮的新钱都在推高小麦、蜡烛和牛奶等基本主食的价格。从 1719 年秋天到 1720 年秋天，价格几乎翻了一番。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law knew he needed to take money out of circulation to bring the financial economy back in line with the real economy. He believed in paper money&mdash;he’d been preaching that gospel for fifteen years. And he thought if he could get people to stop using gold and silver as money, he could both stabilize the economy and, finally, break the link between precious metal and money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳知道他需要把钱从流通中拿出来，让金融经济重新与实体经济接轨。他相信纸币 —— 他已经宣扬这个福音 15 年了。他认为，如果他能让人们停止使用黄金和白银作为货币，他既能稳定经济，又能最终打破贵金属和货币之间的联系。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the first months of 1720 he made it illegal to possess large amounts of gold or silver coins. Suddenly everybody had lots of new gold and silver jewelry. So Law made it illegal to produce any gold object bigger than one ounce, except for crosses and ceremonial chalices. This prompted an immediate outbreak of piety in Paris; big gold crosses were the new new thing. Law banned big gold crosses.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 1720 年的头几个月，他规定拥有大量金币或银币为非法。突然间，每个人都有很多新的金银首饰。因此，法律规定生产任何大于一盎司的黄金物品都是非法的，除了十字架和仪式用的圣杯。这促使巴黎立即爆发了虔诚之心；大金十字架是新的东西。劳又禁止了大金十字架。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As the jewelers were getting rich, Law was starting to lose his grip. He pushed through a series of measures that required people to use paper money for all large purchases. Then he said that, by the end of the year, people would no longer be able to exchange their banknotes for gold and silver. Paper money would just be paper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着珠宝商的发财，劳开始失去控制。他推行了一系列措施，要求人们在所有大宗消费中使用纸币。然后他说，到今年年底，人们将不再能够用纸币兑换金银。纸币将只是纸。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In May 1720, Law went further. He declared the value of paper money would be gradually cut in half. At this point, France flipped out. People rioted for three days. The bank closed. People threw rocks through the windows.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1720 年 5 月，劳更进一步。他宣布纸币的价值将逐渐减半。这时，法国翻脸了。人们暴动了三天。银行关闭了。人们把石头扔进窗户。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A week later, the Regent overruled Law and revoked the order. But it didn’t matter anymore. The system was in freefall. People crowded the streets of Paris, not to trade Mississippi stock but to  exchange their paper money for silver. The bank, of course, didn’t have enough silver. Farmers stopped accepting paper money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一周后，摄政王否决了劳的意见，撤销了该命令。但这已经不重要了。该系统正处于自由落体状态。人们拥挤在巴黎街头，不是为了交易密西西比州的股票，而是为了将他们的纸币换成银币。当然，银行没有足够的银子。农民们不再接受纸币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law was fired, then rehired, then fired again. In an echo of what happened hundreds of years earlier in China, the Regent gave up on paper money, and on banks entirely. The government went back to gold and silver coins and took on new debts to compensate people who had lost money on Mississippi stock and paper notes. It was as if Law had never existed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳被解雇，然后被重新雇用，然后又被解雇。为了呼应几百年前在中国发生的事情，摄政王放弃了纸币，并完全放弃了银行。政府回到了金银币上，并承担了新的债务，以补偿那些在密西西比州股票和纸币上损失的人。这就像法律从未存在过一样。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Law was placed under house arrest. Mobs attacked his house and his coach. His only choice was to flee France, as he had fled England twenty-five years earlier. In December he took a borrowed coach to Brussels, where he stayed under an assumed name, which didn’t matter, because everybody knew who he was anyway, so he went to the theater and, weirdly, got a standing ovation. He went to England, where he kneeled before a panel of judges and was pardoned for killing Beau Wilson in that duel decades earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">劳被软禁。暴徒们袭击了他的房子和他的马车。他唯一的选择是逃离法国，就像他在 25 年前逃离英国一样。12 月，他乘坐一辆借来的马车前往布鲁塞尔，在那里他以假名逗留，这并不重要，因为反正大家都知道他是谁，所以他去了剧院，奇怪的是，他得到了起立鼓掌的机会。他去了英国，在那里他跪在一个法官小组面前，被赦免了几十年前在那场决斗中杀死博·威尔逊的罪行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He kept writing to Orléans, asking to be allowed back. He still believed in his system; he said he could fix everything. Orléans might have eventually agreed, but he died of a heart attack in 1723 at age forty-nine. He was with his mistress at the time.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他不断写信给奥尔良，要求允许他回来。他仍然相信他的系统；他说他可以解决一切问题。奥尔良最终可能同意了，但他在 1723 年死于心脏病，时年四十九岁。当时他正和他的情妇在一起。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Eventually, Law settled in Venice with his son. His common-law wife and his daughter were still in France; he would never see them again. Most of Law’s money was stuck in France, so he lived once again by gambling. He won enough to survive, but he didn’t get rich; creditors were after him until he died in March 1729, just before his fifty-eighth birthday.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最终，劳与他的儿子在威尼斯定居。他那事实上的妻子和女儿还在法国；他再也见不到她们了。劳的大部分钱都滞留在法国，所以他又一次靠赌博生活。他赢得了足够的钱来生存，但他并没有发财；债权人一直在追杀他，直到他在 1729 年 3 月去世，就在他 58 岁生日之前。</p>

<p class="noindent">In late 1720, just as the wheels were coming off the French economy, a Dutch artist published a series of cartoons about what was  happening in France. My favorite shows three men pouring gold coins down Law’s throat in a street crowded with people. Law is squatting, and his butt is bare, and a piece of paper is coming out of it. A man in the crowd is grabbing the paper.</p>

<p class="noindent">1720 年末，就在法国经济的车轮滚滚而来的时候，一位荷兰艺术家发表了一系列关于法国发生的事情的漫画。我最喜欢的是在一条挤满人的街道上，三个人把金币灌进劳的喉咙。劳蹲着，他的屁股光溜溜的，有一张纸从里面出来。人群中的一个人正在抓着那张纸。</p>

</div>

<p class="calibre9">This, more or less, has become the standard view of what the French call John Law’s System and the English call the Mississippi Bubble. Law took all the money and gave France crap in return. He was running a long con, and in the end he was found out.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这或多或少已成为法国人称之为约翰·劳的制度和英国人称之为密西西比泡沫的标准观点。劳拿了所有的钱，却给了法国一些垃圾作为回报。他在进行一个长期的骗局，最后他被发现了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">I don’t buy this view. In 1716, when John Law was first pitching his bank, Orléans went to one of his closest advisors, the Duke of Saint-Simon, to ask him what he thought. Saint-Simon told him  that Law’s ideas made sense. Paper money could be good for France’s economy. But, Saint-Simon said, there was a problem. Unlike the Netherlands, which was a republic, or Great Britain, which had a powerful Parliament, France was an absolute monarchy. The king could do whatever he wanted. And inevitably, the king or the people working for him would get carried away by the power of the bank, and they’d print too much money, and the system would break.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我不相信这种观点。1716 年，当约翰·劳第一次推销他的银行时，奥尔良去找他最亲密的顾问之一，圣西蒙公爵，问他的看法。圣西门告诉他，劳的想法是有道理的。纸币可能对法国的经济有好处。但是，圣西门说，有一个问题。与荷兰的共和制和英国的强大议会不同，法国是一个绝对君主制国家。国王可以做任何他想做的事。而不可避免的是，国王或为他工作的人将被银行的力量冲昏头脑，他们会印刷太多的钱，系统会崩溃。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For modern money to work&mdash;to have banks, and a stock market, and a central bank&mdash;there needs to be tension. Investors and bankers and activists and government officials all need to be arguing over who gets to do what, and when. Often today, the people making those arguments suggest the system is broken: The government is interfering too much or the bankers are getting away with murder. But those arguments themselves are, if not sufficient to make the system work, at least necessary. The push and pull among people with different interests&mdash;lenders and borrowers, investors and workers&mdash;is what keeps money stable. Economic historians have argued that the Bank of England and paper money took off in England when they did in large part because Parliament had just gained power relative to the king. People were more likely to lend money to the government because they thought Parliament would keep the king in line.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">为了让现代货币发挥作用，需要有银行、股票市场和中央银行，需要有紧张关系。投资者、银行家、活动家和政府官员都需要争论谁能做什么，以及何时做。今天，提出这些争论的人往往认为这个系统已经崩溃。政府干预太多，或者银行家们逃脱了谋杀。但是，这些争论本身即使不足以使这个系统运作，至少也是必要的。贷款人和借款人、投资者和工人等具有不同利益的人之间的推拉，是保持货币稳定的原因。经济史学家认为，英格兰银行和纸币之所以在英国兴起，很大程度上是因为议会刚刚获得相对于国王的权力。人们更愿意把钱借给政府，因为他们认为议会会让国王听话。</p>

<p class="calibre9">John Law’s System wasn’t inherently flawed; John Law was inherently flawed. He failed because he wanted too much power&mdash;and when he got it, the power structure in France meant there was no one to push back, no way to create that necessary balance.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">约翰·劳的制度并没有本质上的缺陷；约翰·劳是有本质上的缺陷的。他之所以失败，是因为他想要太多的权力 —— 而当他得到权力时，法国的权力结构意味着没有人可以反击，没有办法创造必要的平衡。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“The founding of a national bank would be fatal in an absolute monarchy,” Saint-Simon said just before Law founded his bank, “whereas in a free country it might be a wise and profitable undertaking.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“在一个绝对的君主制国家，建立国家银行将是致命的”，圣西蒙在劳创办他的银行之前说，“而在一个自由国家，这可能是一项明智和有利的事业。”</p>

<p class="noindent05n">Money feels finite. It feels like there’s only so much to go around; if someone is getting more, someone else must be getting less. In most places at most times, this was mostly true. But then, in the decades after John Law’s death, something changed&mdash;apparently forever, or at least so far.</p>

<p class="noindent05n">金钱给人的感觉是有限的。感觉就像只有这么多可以用；如果有人得到更多，其他人就一定会得到更少。在大多数时候的大多数地方，这大多是真的。但是，在约翰·劳死后的几十年里，一些事情发生了变化，显然是永远地改变了，或者至少是到目前为止。</p>

<p class="noindent2">Now, everyone can have more money. Chapter 8 is, in an oblique way, the story of this transformation. Chapter 9 is about the more intuitive but less rosy corollary: just because everybody can have more money, it doesn’t mean everybody will have more money.</p>

<p class="noindent2">现在，人人都可以拥有更多的钱。第八章以一种间接的方式讲述了这种转变的故事。第九章是关于更直观但不那么美好的推论：仅仅因为每个人都可以拥有更多的钱，并不意味着每个人都会拥有更多的钱。</p>

<p class="noindent">For most of human history, the world was a dark place. The cost of lighting was so profoundly high that when the sun went down people often just huddled in their shack or hut and waited for dawn.</p>

<p class="noindent">在人类历史的大部分时间里，世界是一个黑暗的地方。照明的成本是如此之高，以至于当太阳下山时，人们往往只是蜷缩在他们的棚屋或小屋里，等待着黎明的到来。</p> 

<p class="calibre9">The story of how we got from huddling in the dark to having as much light as we want at the flick of a switch explains a ridiculous amount about the world. It explains why most people on Earth no longer have to worry constantly about starving to death. It explains why most people aren’t subsistence farmers&mdash;why we can have a world of people who make their living as personal trainers and HR professionals and plumbers. It explains climate change. It also explains why the amount of money in the world is not fixed, why one person’s gain is not another’s loss, why everybody can have more money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们如何从蜷缩在黑暗中，到一按开关就能获得我们想要的光亮，这个故事解释了关于这个世界的许多荒谬之处。它解释了为什么地球上的大多数人不再需要经常担心饿死了。它解释了为什么大多数人不是自给自足的农民 —— 为什么我们可以有一个以私人教练、人力资源专家和水管工为生的世界。它解释了气候变化。它还解释了为什么世界上的货币数量不是固定的，为什么一个人的收益不是另一个人的损失，为什么每个人都可以拥有更多的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Toward the end of the twentieth century, Bill Nordhaus, an economist at Yale, became obsessed with the history of light. He knew that light is a thing society has needed forever. And he realized that if he really understood the economics of artificial  light, he would understand how to measure the history of material progress.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在二十世纪末，耶鲁大学的经济学家比尔·诺德豪斯（Bill Nordhaus）开始迷恋上了光的历史。他知道，光是社会永远需要的东西。他意识到，如果他真正理解了人工照明的经济学，他就会理解如何衡量物质进步的历史。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The puzzle Nordhaus set out to solve was this: How has the price of artificial light changed over the past, oh, say, 4,000 years? Price, for economists, is basically the center of the world. It is where the abstraction that is money meets reality.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">诺德豪斯要解决的难题是这个。在过去，哦，比如说，四千年来，人造光的价格是如何变化的？价格，对于经济学家来说，基本上是世界的中心。它是货币这一抽象概念与现实的结合点。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Nordhaus decided to start his research in ancient Babylon (a city in Mesopotamia, the same region where accountants invented writing). To figure out what Babylonians paid for light, Nordhaus bought an ancient-style oil lamp. The Babylonians, conveniently enough, used sesame oil to fuel their lamps. So Nordhaus bought some sesame oil at the grocery store. He borrowed a light meter from a guy in the facilities department at Yale. Then he put the lamp on his dining room table, lit it, and measured how much light the lamp put out, and how long it took to burn through a quarter cup of sesame oil.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">诺德豪斯决定在古巴比伦（美索不达米亚的一个城市，也是会计师发明文字的地区）开始他的研究。为了弄清巴比伦人的照明费用，诺德豪斯买了一盏古式油灯。巴比伦人很方便地使用芝麻油作为他们灯的燃料。所以诺德豪斯在杂货店买了一些芝麻油。他从耶鲁大学设施部门的一个人那里借了一个测光表。然后他把灯放在他的餐桌上，点燃它，并测量了灯的亮度，以及烧完四分之一杯芝麻油所需的时间。</p>

<p class="calibre9">From another scholar, Nordhaus got figures for how much workers earned in ancient Babylon, and how much sesame oil cost. Then he did some math that allowed him to make the price of artificial light comparable across all of human history. Eventually, he could answer this question: If you were a typical worker in ancient Babylon and you spent a whole day’s earnings on light, how long could you illuminate a small room with as much light as you get today from a 60-watt incandescent lightbulb?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">从另一位学者那里，诺德豪斯得到了古巴比伦的工人收入和芝麻油价格的数字。然后，他做了一些数学计算，使他能够使人工照明的价格在整个人类历史上具有可比性。最终，他可以回答这个问题。如果你是古代巴比伦的一个典型工人，你把一整天的收入都花在了照明上，那么你能用今天一个 60 瓦的白炽灯泡的光照亮一个小房间多长时间？</p>

<p class="calibre9">Ten minutes! A day of work only got you ten minutes of light!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">十分钟! 一天的工作只给你带来了十分钟的光明！</p>

<p class="calibre9">In ancient Babylon, it took a lot of hours of human labor to grow sesame seeds. It took a lot of hours to press those seeds into oil. As a result, sesame oil&mdash;and, more to the point, the light you got by burning sesame oil&mdash;was really expensive.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在古代巴比伦，种植芝麻需要大量的人力劳动。将这些种子压榨成油也需要很多时间。因此，芝麻油 —— 更重要的是，你通过燃烧芝麻油得到的光线 —— 非常昂贵。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Over time, around the world, people made light any way they could. In the Caribbean and in parts of Asia, people made lanterns  out of fireflies. In parts of Great Britain, people took (dead) birds called storm petrels, stuck wicks down their throats, and turned them into candles.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着时间的推移，在世界各地，人们以任何方式创造光明。在加勒比地区和亚洲部分地区，人们用萤火虫制作灯笼。在大不列颠的部分地区，人们把叫做风暴海燕的（死）鸟，把灯芯塞进它们的喉咙，然后把它们变成蜡烛。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But for the most part, for thousands of years, artificial light was expensive and the world stayed dark. This may sound sort of romantic&mdash;the moonlight, the stars!&mdash;but for a lot of people, a lot of the time, the dark was awful. The dark was not some beautiful thing you went out and explored. It was something dangerous. Something that trapped you. In Paris at one point, there was actually a law that said, every night, everybody had to give their keys to a magistrate, go home, and lock themselves in the house.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在大多数情况下，数千年来，人造光是昂贵的，世界保持着黑暗。这听起来可能有点浪漫 —— 月光，星星！ —— 但对很多人来说，很多时候，黑暗是可怕的。黑暗不是一些你出去探索的美丽事物。它是一种危险的东西。它是困住你的东西。在巴黎，有一段时间，实际上有一条法律规定，每天晚上，每个人都必须把他们的钥匙交给法官，回家，并把自己锁在房子里。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the 1700s, a new fuel source for light was becoming widespread: whale oil. This was very, very bad for whales. But it did mean light got cheaper and better. When Nordhaus crunched the numbers for Europe in the 1700s, here’s what he found.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到了十七世纪，一种新的照明燃料来源开始广泛使用：鲸鱼油。这对鲸鱼来说是非常、非常糟糕的。但这确实意味着灯光变得更便宜、更好。当诺德豪斯对欧洲在十七世纪的数字进行分析时，他发现了以下情况：</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="caption">
<em class="calibre4">Credit: Quoctrung Bui</em></p>

<p class="calibre9"> Things definitely got better for people (and tragically worse for whales). Humanity had gone from a day’s labor buying ten minutes of light to a day’s labor buying an hour. But it took 4,000 years to make that gain!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">对人类来说，事情肯定会变得更好（而对鲸鱼来说，不幸的是更糟糕）。人类已经从一天的劳动购买十分钟的光亮变成了一天的劳动购买一小时。但它花了 4000 年的时间才取得这一成果！</p> <p

<p class="calibre9">In the 1700s, life everywhere on Earth still looked more like ancient Babylon than the modern world. People still traveled the same way&mdash;by foot, by horse, by sailing ship. Most people were still subsistence farmers, usually living in some kind of hut, trying to grow enough food to not starve to death.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在十七世纪，地球上各处的生活仍然看起来更像古巴比伦，而不是现代世界。人们仍然以同样的方式旅行，用脚、用马、用帆船。大多数人仍然是自给自足的农民，通常住在某种小屋里，努力种植足够的食物以避免饿死。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, around 1800, everything changed. When you look at history, it’s like there are two different economic universes: the universe before 1800 and what came after. This moment is the Industrial Revolution, which started with making steam power and cloth in Great Britain and spread to making everything everywhere. It’s frankly not entirely clear why so much changed at this particular  moment. But there are a couple things that are essential to the history of light.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后，在 1800 年左右，一切都改变了。当你看历史时，就像有两个不同的经济宇宙：1800 年之前的宇宙和之后的宇宙。这个时刻就是工业革命，它从在英国制造蒸汽动力和布匹开始，蔓延到世界各地制造一切。坦率地说，我们并不完全清楚为什么在这个特定的时刻会发生如此大的变化。但有几件事情对光的历史至关重要。</p>

<p class="calibre9">One is, basically, practical applications of science. The important breakthrough wasn’t that the Earth orbits the sun or how the force of gravity changes based on the distance between two objects; the breakthrough was discovering a system for making new discoveries, the scientific method. Not all of these discoveries had practical applications, but some did.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一个是，基本上，科学的实际应用。重要的突破并不是地球绕着太阳运行，也不是引力如何根据两个物体之间的距离而变化；突破是发现了一个做出新发现的系统，即科学方法。并非所有这些发现都有实际应用，但有些确实如此。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Around 1850, a scientist named Abraham Gesner (he was a physician who had also studied geology) discovered a new technique for turning pitch or oil into a fuel he called kerosene. It was an extraordinary breakthrough&mdash;it was just so much better than every light source that had come before. It was brighter, and cleaner, and much, much cheaper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大约在 1850 年，一位名叫亚伯拉罕·格斯纳（Abraham Gesner）的科学家（他是一位医生，也曾研究过地质学）发现了一种将沥青或石油变成他称之为煤油的燃料的新技术。这是一个非凡的突破，它比以前的所有光源都好得多。它更亮，更干净，而且便宜得多。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> With kerosene, Nordhaus figured, a day’s wages bought a European worker about five hours of light. In about fifty years, the amount of light a worker could buy rose fivefold&mdash;roughly the same amount it had risen in the four thousand years before that.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 据诺德豪斯计算，用煤油，一个欧洲工人一天的工资可以买到大约五个小时的照明。在大约 50 年的时间里，一个工人可以买到的光照量上升了五倍 —— 大约与之前四千年的上升量相同。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-170" class="sect1">The Lightbulb Moment 灯泡的时刻</h1>

<p class="noindent">Thomas Edison and the lightbulb&mdash;the big moment in the history of light&mdash;is, of course, partly a story about science and technology. But it’s not only that. It’s also a story about money.</p>

<p class="noindent">托马斯·爱迪生和灯泡 —— 这是光的历史上的重要时刻 —— 当然，部分是一个关于科学和技术的故事。但它不仅仅是这样。它也是一个关于金钱的故事。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the 1870s, lots of people were trying to use electricity to make light. Inventors in the United States and France were working on a technology called arc lights&mdash;these big, superbright lights that hung from high poles. They worked as street lamps and lights in factories. But they were too big and too bright to be used in homes or offices.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在十九世纪 70 年代，很多人都在尝试用电来制造灯光。美国和法国的发明家们正在研究一种叫做电弧灯的技术，这些超大且超亮的灯挂在高高的电线杆上。它们可以作为路灯和工厂的照明。但它们太大、太亮，无法用于家庭或办公室。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Edison first went to see arc lights in early September 1878 and decided immediately that he could do better. But doing better&mdash;figuring out how to invent the lightbulb as we know it&mdash;would be expensive. Those stories of Edison spending years doing thousands of experiments to get the bulb right aren’t entirely accurate in one important way&mdash;it wasn’t just Edison alone in a room. By this time, he had a whole invention factory next to his house in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where he paid scribes and mechanics and machinists and blacksmiths to help him invent stuff.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">爱迪生在 1878 年 9 月初第一次去看电弧灯，并立即决定，他可以做得更好。但是，做得更好 —— 即，弄清楚如何发明我们所知的灯泡 —— 将是昂贵的。那些关于爱迪生花了数年时间做了数以千计的实验以获得正确的灯泡的故事在一个重要方面并不完全准确 —— 这不仅仅是爱迪生独自在一个房间里。这时，他在新泽西州门洛帕克的房子旁边有一个完整的发明工厂，他在那里付钱给抄写员、机械师、机器师和铁匠，帮助他发明东西。

<p class="calibre9">Edison was rich and famous&mdash;he’d already invented the record player!&mdash;but even so, he knew he couldn’t afford to invent the lightbulb on his own. He wrote to his lawyer, “All I want at present is to be provided with funds to push the light rapidly.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">爱迪生很有钱，也很有名气 —— 他已经发明了唱片机！但即便如此，他也知道自己没有能力独自发明灯泡。他在给他的律师的信中说：“我目前所希望的是得到资金，以迅速推动电灯的发展。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Fortunately for Edison, there was now a way for a promising inventor to quickly raise lots of money from lots of people: he could create a company. Companies were no longer just these things governments created to go do imperialism. Now they were for everybody.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 对爱迪生来说，幸运的是，现在有一种方法可以让一个有前途的发明家迅速从许多人那里筹集大量资金：他可以创建一个公司。公司不再仅仅是政府为了搞帝国主义而创建的东西。现在，他们是为每个人服务的。</p> 

<p class="calibre9">On October 16, just a month and a half after Edison had seen the arc lights, the Edison Electric Light Company was created. It would eventually morph into General Electric&mdash;GE. Like many companies created then (and now), it was a limited liability corporation (an LLC). This meant investors could put money into the company and be guaranteed that, if it went bust, they would lose only the money they’d put in, not any of their personal wealth. This seems so obvious today that to even mention it is sort of confusing; of course you can’t lose more than your investment. But for a long time, if you invested in a business, and that business owed people money, you were on the hook. The people the business owed money to could, say, seize your house to make good on the debts of the business you invested in. The corporation and the limited liability that went with it made it much easier for people like Edison to find willing investors.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">10 月 16 日，就在爱迪生看到电弧灯的一个半月后，爱迪生电灯公司成立了。它最终演变成了通用电气（GE）。像当时（和现在）创建的许多公司一样，它是一家有限责任公司（LLC）。这意味着投资者可以向公司投入资金，并保证如果公司破产，他们将只损失他们投入的资金，而不是他们的任何个人财富。这在今天看来是非常明显的，甚至提到它都有点令人困惑；当然，你的损失不会超过你的投资。但在很长一段时间里，如果你投资于一家企业，而这家企业欠了别人的钱，你就得负责任。该企业欠钱的人可以，比如说，扣押你的房子来偿还你投资的企业的债务。公司和随之而来的有限责任使爱迪生等人更容易找到愿意投资的人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the weeks after the Edison Electric Light Company was created, investors rushed to put up $50,000 (about $1 million in today’s money), giving Edison the money he needed to pay his team. Those investors hoped to become rich from another financial innovation that was essential to the explosion of invention around this time: patents. The point of patents&mdash;which the founders of America thought was so important they put it in the Constitution&mdash;is to give people a financial incentive to come up with new ideas, and to share those ideas with the world. A patent is a temporary, government-granted monopoly on new ideas. So if you come up with a new idea that lots of people are willing to pay for, you can make  a lot of money. The investors in the Edison Electric Light company were promised a share of the profits from whatever electricity or lightbulb-related patents Edison was awarded.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在爱迪生电灯公司创建后的几周内，投资者们急忙投入了 5 万美元（按今天的货币计算约为 100 万美元），为爱迪生提供了他需要的资金来支付他的团队。这些投资者希望从另一项金融创新中致富，这项创新对这一时期的发明爆炸至关重要：专利。美国的创始人认为专利非常重要，并将其写入宪法，专利的意义在于为人们提供经济上的激励，让他们想出新的想法，并与世界分享这些想法。专利是政府授予的对新想法的临时垄断。因此，如果你想出了一个很多人都愿意付钱的新想法，你就可以赚很多钱。爱迪生电灯公司的投资者被承诺从爱迪生获得的任何与电或灯泡有关的专利中分享利润。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Just over a year after his company was formed, Edison was awarded US patent 223,898 for the electric lamp, aka the lightbulb. He wasn’t the only inventor working on lightbulbs, and there are disputes remaining today over who invented what when. But Edison went on to receive dozens more patents for lightbulbs and for ways to build an electrical grid to power those bulbs.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">爱迪生在其公司成立仅一年多后，就获得了电灯（又称灯泡）的美国专利（223,898）。他并不是唯一从事灯泡研究的发明家，至今仍有关于谁在何时发明了什么的争议。但爱迪生后来又获得了几十项关于灯泡和建立电网为这些灯泡供电的专利。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few years later, Edison started building the first power grid&mdash;not just his first, but the first in the history of the world&mdash;in New York City. For this he needed lots more money, and he founded a whole other company to raise it. In September 1882, just four years after Edison saw arc lights and knew he could do better, someone flipped the switch at a new power plant and suddenly lightbulbs in homes and offices scattered around lower Manhattan glowed. It was like magic. But Edison wasn’t at the power plant to flip the switch. He was a few blocks away, literally on Wall Street, hanging out with J. P. Morgan and a bunch of other bankers to witness this momentous occasion. It was money, as much as anything, that made the lights go on.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几年后，爱迪生开始在纽约市建造第一个电网 —— 不仅仅是他的第一个，而是世界历史上的第一个。为此，他需要更多的钱，他成立了另一家公司来筹集资金。1882 年 9 月，就在爱迪生看到电弧灯并知道他可以做得更好的四年之后，有人在一个新的发电厂打开了开关，散布在曼哈顿下城的家庭和办公室的灯泡突然发亮。这就像魔术一样。但爱迪生并没有在发电厂里打开开关。他在几个街区外，实际上是在华尔街，与 J.P.摩根和其他一群银行家一起见证这一重要时刻。是钱，就像其他东西一样，使灯亮了起来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It wasn’t all magic. The first power plants burned dirty coal, polluting the city. A few decades later, Edison built a huge power plant on the east side of Manhattan. At some point the city health department started sending inspectors. “When it was found health department men were trying to photograph the smokestacks,” the <em class="calibre4">New York Times</em> reported, “scouts were put on the company’s roof who ordered the feeding of coal stopped whenever photographers appeared.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这并不全是魔术。第一批发电厂烧的是脏煤，污染了城市。几十年后，爱迪生在曼哈顿的东边建了一个巨大的发电厂。在某个时候，城市卫生部门开始派出检查人员。“当发现卫生部门的人试图拍摄烟囱时”，"《纽约时报》报道说，“侦察员被安排在公司的屋顶上，只要摄影师出现，他们就命令停止喂煤。” </p>

<p class="calibre9"> Over time, though, power&mdash;and, with it, light&mdash;kept getting cheaper (and cleaner). A day’s wages bought more and more. This was true not only about light, but about almost everything. The internal combustion engine led to tractors, which made farmers wildly more productive. Suddenly, for the first time in human history, most people didn’t have to spend their lives trying to grow (or kill or find) food. This went on decade after decade, all through the twentieth century. All kinds of things got much cheaper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">不过，随着时间的推移，电力 —— 以及随之而来的光 —— 不断变得更便宜（更清洁）。一天的工资可以买到越来越多的东西。不仅是光，而且几乎所有的东西都是如此。内燃机导致了拖拉机的出现，使农民的生产力大大提升。突然间，在人类历史上第一次，大多数人不必再为种植（或杀戮或寻找）食物而耗费生命。这种情况持续了十年又十年，一直持续到二十世纪。各种各样的东西都变得更便宜了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bill Nordhaus, the Yale economist, did his light study at the end of the twentieth century. By that time, if a typical worker spent a day’s wages on light, here’s how long they could light up a room:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">耶鲁大学的经济学家比尔·诺德豪斯（Bill Nordhaus）在二十世纪末做了他的灯光研究。到那个时候，如果一个典型的工人把一天的工资花在灯光上，下面是他们可以照亮一个房间的时间：</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Because of the brain-melting scale of a few centuries of continuous improvements, a day’s labor buys 20,000 times as much light as it did just two hundred years ago. This happened because people figured out lots of clever ways to get more output for each hour of work. Not just light; we can now produce profoundly more food and clothes and everything else than our grandparents could. We work less and get more.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">由于几个世纪以来不断改进的脑力劳动规模，一天的劳动可以买到两百多年前的两万倍的光。这是因为人们想出了很多聪明的方法，以使每小时的工作获得更多的产出。不仅仅是光；我们现在可以比我们的祖辈生产更多的食物、衣服和其他东西。我们工作得更少，得到的更多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This productivity growth isn’t all good. The environmental consequences have been devastating.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这种生产力增长并不全是好事。其环境后果是毁灭性的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But it has made almost everyone richer. It means, in real terms, almost everybody has more money than their ancestors could have imagined.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但它几乎使每个人都更富有。这意味着，从实际情况看，几乎每个人都拥有比他们的祖先所能想象的更多的钱。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-36">But Really: <em class="calibre4">Can</em> Everybody Have More Money? 但，是真的吗？人人都有更多钱？</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">When you replace oil lamps with lightbulbs, people don’t have to live in the dark anymore. When you build machines that make it cheaper to spin fiber into yarn, people can suddenly afford more than one shirt, more than one dress. But for the guy whose job used to be going around town lighting up each gas-powered streetlight, or the lady whose job used to be spinning yarn in her cottage, those innovations are a disaster.</p>

<p class="noindent">当你用灯泡取代油灯时，人们就不必再生活在黑暗中。当你建造机器，使纤维纺成纱线的成本降低时，人们突然可以买得起不止一件衬衫，不止一件衣服。但是，对于那些曾经的工作是绕着镇子照亮每盏燃气路灯的人，或者那些曾经的工作是在自己的小屋里纺纱的女士，这些创新是一场灾难。</p>

<p class="calibre9">We celebrate people who create jobs, but in the long run, we get richer by destroying jobs&mdash;by figuring out how to do the same amount of work with fewer people. This is not quite a paradox (because there’s an eventual solution to the problem, which we’ll get to). But for the people caught up in the destruction, it sucks.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们纪念创造就业机会的人，但从长远来看，我们通过破坏工作岗位 —— 通过找出如何用更少的人做同样数量的工作而变得更富有。这不完全是一个悖论（因为这个问题有一个最终的解决方案，我们会讨论这个问题）。但是对于那些被卷入破坏的人来说，这很糟糕。</p>

<p class="calibre9">We live in a moment when this tension is acute&mdash;when, as the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said, software is eating the world. Kayak and Expedia made it easier and cheaper for people to buy plane tickets&mdash;by putting travel agents out of business. Trucks driven by computers instead of people will make it cheaper to move goods around the country. As a result, it will be cheaper for us to  buy stuff. So we’ll be able to buy more stuff, or to buy the same amount of stuff and save more money. Driverless trucks will make us richer as a society. But they will not improve life for truck drivers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们生活在一个这种紧张的时刻 —— 正如风险资本家马克·安德烈森（Marc Andreessen）所说，软件正在吃掉世界。<em>Kayak</em> 和 <em>Expedia</em> 让人们更容易、更便宜地购买飞机票 —— 同时使旅行社破产。由计算机而不是人驾驶的卡车将使全国各地的货物运输变得更加便宜。因此，我们买东西也会更便宜。因此，我们将能够购买更多的东西，或者购买相同数量的东西，并节省更多的钱。无人驾驶卡车将使我们这个社会更加富有。但它们不会改善卡车司机的生活。</p>

<p class="calibre9">All this has happened before. Maybe not <em class="calibre4">all</em> of this. Not the part about the computers, and driverless trucks, and travel agents. But the part about machines taking people’s jobs and causing massive upheaval&mdash;that part happened very dramatically in the early 1800s in England. And the parallels between what happened then and what’s happening now are really striking. Last time, for a long time, it did not go well. Just ask the Luddites.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这一切以前都发生过。也许不是<strong class="calibre4">所有</strong>的事情。不是关于计算机、无人驾驶卡车和旅行社的部分。但是，关于机器抢走人们的工作并造成大规模动荡的部分，这部分在十九世纪初的英国发生了非常大的变化。当时发生的事情和现在发生的事情之间的相似之处真的很惊人。上一次，在很长一段时间里，它并不顺利。问问卢德分子（Luddites）就知道了。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-179" class="sect1">Sympathy for the Luddites</h1>
<p class="noindent">The story of the original Luddites is way more revelatory than the contemporary meaning of the word suggests. The Luddites weren’t people opposed to new technology because they hated change; they were skilled workers who saw machines taking their jobs and decided to fight back.</p>

<p class="noindent">最初的卢德分子的故事比这个词的当代含义更具启示性。卢德分子并不是因为讨厌变化而反对新技术的人；他们是看到机器夺走他们的工作而决定反击的熟练工人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It happened in England in the early 1800s&mdash;in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, which was built on the cloth business. At the time, cloth was really expensive and hard to make; most people could only afford one or two sets of clothes. Cloth making required many specialized steps and was mostly done by skilled artisans who worked at home or in small shops. Women would take raw wool or cotton and spin it into yarn. Men would weave it into rough cloth on a hand loom. And then these other guys called croppers would crop the fuzz of the cloth with giant, forty-pound shears.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">它发生在十九世纪初的英国。在工业革命的中期，工业革命是建立在布匹生意之上的。当时，布真的很贵，而且很难制作；大多数人只能买得起一两套衣服。制布需要许多专门的步骤，大多由在家里或小商店工作的熟练工匠完成。妇女会把生羊毛或棉花纺成纱线。男人在手摇织机上将其织成粗布。然后这些被称为“剪子”的人用巨大的、40 磅重的剪子剪掉布上的绒毛。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Many of the people who could make cloth were making a good living by the standards of the time, and they had the freedom of  working for themselves. Weavers would walk into the pub with a five-pound note stuck in their hat&mdash;conspicuous consumption, a hundred years before the term was coined. Artisans even had a tradition called “St. Monday,” which was basically getting really drunk on Sunday, then taking Monday off.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">按照当时的标准，许多能做布的人都能过上好日子，而且他们有为自己工作的自由。织布工走进酒馆时，会在帽子里插上一张五英镑的纸币 —— “显摆的消费”（conspicuous consumption），比这个词的诞生还要早一百年。工匠们甚至有一个叫做“圣周一”的传统，基本上就是在周日喝得酩酊大醉，然后周一休息。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The fact that the jobs paid well was part of their undoing. If you’re a worker, getting paid a lot for your work is great. But if you are the cloth merchant paying all these spinners and weavers and croppers, at some point, you start thinking, there’s got to be a cheaper way to do this. And at this moment in England, people were starting to build new machines that did all these different things. Someone invented a machine to spin fiber into yarn. Someone else came up with a machine that could turn that yarn into cloth with fewer workers. Another inventor figured out a way to trim the fuzz off fabric so you didn’t need the croppers and their forty-pound scissors.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">工作报酬高是他们失败的部分原因。如果你是一个工人，为你的工作获得高额报酬是件好事。但是，如果你是支付所有这些纺纱工、织布工和庄稼人的布商，在某种程度上，你会开始思考，一定会有更便宜的方法来做这件事。而此时在英国，人们开始制造新的机器，做所有这些不同的事情。有人发明了一台将纤维纺成纱线的机器。还有人想出了一种机器，可以用更少的工人把纱线变成布。另一位发明家想出了一种方法，可以修剪织物上的绒毛，这样你就不需要剪子和他们的 40 磅剪刀了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Sort of like in Silicon Valley today, there was all this action. People were getting rich, people were making deals. One example: stockings. Stockings were big back then. (Picture in your mind a portrait of the Founding Fathers, then zoom in on their calves. Stockings.) According to local lore, a “workman named Roper” in rural England built a “rude and imperfect” prototype of a machine that could make ribbed stockings. Then a local farmer who wanted to get into the stocking game sold a horse for £5 and used the money to buy the rights to the machine from Roper. The farmer died a rich man; no sources tell us how Roper felt about the deal.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有点像今天的硅谷，有所有这些行动。人们在发财，人们在做交易。一个例子：丝袜。丝袜在当时是很重要的。(在你的脑海中想象一幅开国元勋的画像，然后放大他们的小腿 —— 丝袜） 根据当地的传说，英国农村的一个“名叫罗珀的工人”制造了一台“粗制滥造”的机器原型，可以制造罗纹袜。然后，当地一个想加入长筒袜游戏的农民以 5 英镑的价格卖掉了一匹马，并用这笔钱向罗珀购买了机器的权利。这位农民死后成了富翁；没有资料告诉我们罗珀对这笔交易的看法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is really the first time in history that technological change for workers happened on this scale and at this rate. Today, we assume change is constant, and that some jobs&mdash;blacksmiths, switchboard operators, travel agents&mdash;will just disappear. But back  then, the world wasn’t like that. Things didn’t change that much from one generation to the next. In earlier times, British law had actually restricted new machines that threatened workers. Allowing these new machines at that time was a choice that the British government was making. To the skilled workers of the day, it seemed like a bad choice.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这确实是历史上第一次以这样的规模和速度发生针对工人的技术变革。今天，我们认为变化是恒定的，一些工作 —— 铁匠、总机操作员、旅行社 —— 会直接消失。但在那时，世界并不是这样的。事情从一代人到另一代人并没有那么多变化。在早期，英国法律实际上已经限制了威胁工人的新机器。当时允许这些新机器的出现是英国政府的一个选择。对于当时的技术工人来说，这似乎是一个糟糕的选择。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The cloth workers thought they could convince the country to make a different choice by launching a kind of underground war against the machines. In 1811, mysterious letters started showing up in newspapers and on the walls of village markets and in the mailboxes of the owners of the machines. Here’s one. (Shearing frames, by the way, are machines that replaced the croppers with giant shears.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">布业工人认为，他们可以通过发动一种反对机器的地下战争来说服国家做出不同的选择。1811 年，神秘的信件开始出现在报纸、乡村市场的墙壁上和机器所有者的邮箱里。这里有一封。(顺便说一下，剪板机是用巨大的剪子取代庄稼人的机器。) </p>

<p class="noindent1">To Mr Smith Shearing Frame Holder at Hill End Yorkshire.</p>

<p class="noindent1">至约克山下的剪羊毛框架持有者史密斯·舍凌先生</p>

<p class="noindent1">Sir</p>

<p class="noindent1">先生</p>

<p class="noindent1">Information has just been given in that you are a holder of those detestable Shearing Frames, and I was desired by my Men to write to you and give you fair Warning to pull them down… if they are not taken down by the end of next Week, I will detach one of my Lieutenants with at least 300 Men to destroy them and furthermore take Notice that if you give us the Trouble of coming so far we will increase your misfortune by burning your Buildings down to Ashes and if you have Impudence to fire upon any of my Men, they have orders to murder you, &amp; burn all your Housing…</p>

<p class="noindent1">刚刚得到的消息是，你是那些可恶的剪羊毛框架的持有者，我的手下希望我给你写信，给你公平的警告，让你把它们拆掉…… 如果你在下周结束前还不拆除，我将派一名中尉带着至少 300 人去摧毁它们，此外，请注意，如果你给我们带来这么大的麻烦，我们将把你的建筑物烧成灰烬，从而增加你的不幸。</p>

<p class="signed">Redressers</p>

<p class="signed">Ned Ludd…</p>

<p class="signed">陆军将军签名</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Edward “Ned” Ludd, rebel leader, founder of the Luddites, was said to be holed up in Sherwood Forest, in Nottinghamshire, like Robin Hood. But also like Robin Hood, Ned Ludd was a myth. There may have been a stocking knitter of that name a few decades before who got mad and smashed up some stocking-making equipment. That’s what one newspaper editor said, anyway. But General Ludd, leader of the army of redressers, was an invention&mdash;someone made him up, and the myth spread.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">爱德华·“内德”·鲁德（Edward "Ned" Ludd），反叛领袖，卢德分子的创始人，据说和罗宾汉一样，藏身于诺丁汉郡的舍伍德森林。但和罗宾汉一样，内德·卢德也是一个神话。几十年前可能有一个叫这个名字的丝袜编织者，他发了疯，砸毁了一些丝袜制作设备。总之，一位报纸编辑是这么说的。但卢德将军，矫正者大军的领袖，是一个发明 —— 有人编造了他，而这个神话也随之传播开来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People had been writing angry letters before, even occasionally attacking factories. But somehow, appointing a nonexistent general changed things. The invention of Ned Ludd made the whole thing seem bigger. There weren’t just a few disgruntled workers. There was a secret army of what people started calling Luddites spreading across northern England.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们之前一直在写愤怒的信，甚至偶尔会攻击工厂。但不知为何，任命一位不存在的将军改变了事情。奈德·卢德的发明使整个事情看起来更大。不仅仅是几个心怀不满的工人。有一支由人们称为“卢德”的秘密军队在英格兰北部蔓延。</p>

<p class="calibre9">These Luddites weren’t some anti-technology cult. They weren’t back-to-the-land proto-hippies. They just wanted to get rid of the machines that were taking their jobs. In Nottinghamshire, in the spring of 1811, they started doing it by force. Almost every night, week after week, a band of armed stocking-frame knitters went out and, using hatchets and sledgehammers, broke into factories and smashed the wooden machines that were being used to knit stockings.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这些卢徳主义者并不是什么反技术的邪教。他们并不是回归原点的嬉皮士。他们只是想摆脱那些夺走他们工作的机器。在诺丁汉郡，1811 年的春天，他们开始用武力来做这件事。几乎每天晚上，周而复始，一队武装的长筒袜编织者出门，使用斧头和大锤，闯入工厂，砸碎用于编织长筒袜的木制机器。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Within a few months Ned Ludd was everywhere. When one factory owner walked down the street, kids taunted him. “I’m Ned Ludd!” “No, I’m Ned Ludd!” One government official got a letter from someone claiming to be Ned Ludd’s solicitor filing charges against him in Ludd Court. People sang about Ludd in pubs.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几个月内，内德·卢德的身影无处不在。当一位工厂主走在街上时，孩子们嘲弄他。“我是内德·卢德！”“不，我是内德·卢德！” 一位政府官员收到了一封自称是内德·卢德律师的信，在卢德法庭上对他提出指控。人们在酒吧里唱起了卢德的歌。</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">卢德烧毁了一家棉织厂，并袭击了用来收割羊毛的机器。有几十次又几十次的袭击，而且还在蔓延。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was only a few decades since the revolution in France, and the authorities in Britain were terrified. In 1812, Parliament introduced a bill to make destroying machines punishable by death. Lord Byron, the poet, had a lesser-known career as a member of Parliament. His very first speech there was in response to the bill. The acts of the Luddites, Byron said,</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">法国的革命才过去几十年，英国的当局就吓坏了。1812 年，议会提出了一项法案，规定破坏机器的人可被处以死刑。诗人拜伦勋爵作为国会议员有一个不太知名的职业生涯。他在那里的第一次演讲就是对该法案的回应。拜伦说：</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">… have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress.… nothing but absolute want could have driven a large and once honest and industrious body of the people into the commission of excesses so hazardous to themselves, their families, and the community.…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">路德主义者们的行为是在最窘迫的情况下产生的…… 除了绝对的匮乏之外，没有任何东西能驱使一大批曾经诚实勤劳的人做出对自己、家人和社会如此有害的过分行为……</p>

<p class="noindent2">这些人愿意挖掘，但铲子却在别人手里；他们不耻下问，但没有人救济他们。他们自己的生存手段被切断了；所有其他的工作都被预先占用了；他们的过度行为，无论多么令人痛惜和谴责，都很难让人感到惊讶……</p>

<p class="noindent2">Setting aside the palpable injustice and the certain inefficiency of the bill, are there not capital punishments sufficient on your statutes?

<p class="calibre9"> Yes, the Lords decided. Death by hanging was the remedy for a starving and desperate populace. The bill was rushed through Parliament as an emergency measure. But the attacks just kept getting bigger.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 是的，上议院决定。吊死是对饥饿和绝望的民众的补救措施。该法案作为一项紧急措施被匆匆通过议会。但袭击事件却越来越多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">On the night of April 11, about a hundred Luddites gathered in a field near a town called Huddersfield in the north of England. Many of them were croppers&mdash;the guys with the heavy shears who trimmed the fuzz off woolen cloth&mdash;and they were there to attack a factory on the edge of town. More people joined them as they walked to the factory; eventually, there were about 150 people in all. They had whatever weapons they could find&mdash;guns, hammers, hatchets. Some just had stones. They weren’t going after the factory owner, William Cartwright. They were going to destroy his machines&mdash;the machines that were stealing their jobs.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">4 月 11 日晚上，大约一百名卢德分子聚集在英格兰北部一个叫哈德斯菲尔德的小镇附近的田野上。他们中的许多人都是庄稼人 —— 这些人拿着沉重的剪子，修剪羊毛布上的绒毛 —— 他们在那里攻击镇边的一家工厂。当他们走到工厂时，更多的人加入了他们；最后，总共有大约 150 人。他们拿着任何他们能找到的武器，枪，锤子，斧头。有些人只是拿着石头。他们并不是要去找工厂老板威廉·卡特赖特（William Cartwright）。他们要摧毁他的机器 —— 那些抢走他们工作的机器。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cartwright had just started using shearing frames, the machines that were replacing the croppers. The month before, Luddites had destroyed a wagonload of new machines bound for Cartwright’s factory, and he was prepared for a direct attack.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">卡特赖特刚刚开始使用剪板机，这种机器正在取代庄稼人。一个月前，卢德分子毁掉了一车运往卡特赖特工厂的新机器，他已经做好了直接攻击的准备。</p> 

<p class="calibre9">He had started sleeping in the factory, along with four soldiers and five of his workmen. The soldiers were stationed upstairs, where they could crouch behind stone defenses and shoot out at attackers. Cartwright reinforced the factory door with iron studs and bars. He put a vat of sulfuric acid at the top of the stairs, to pour down on attackers who made it through the door. A gate outside the factory yard was patrolled by two sentries.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他已经开始在工厂里睡觉，同时还有四名士兵和五名工人。士兵们驻扎在楼上，他们可以蹲在石头防线后面，向攻击者开枪。卡特赖特用铁钉和铁条加固了工厂的大门。他在楼梯顶上放了一桶硫酸，用来浇灌闯入大门的袭击者。工厂院子外面的大门由两名哨兵负责巡逻。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Just after midnight, the Luddites marched on the factory. They managed to capture the sentries, and they broke through the gate with hatchets. Inside the factory, a dog started barking. Cartwright woke up and roused the guards, who started shooting from  the second story. The Luddites with sledgehammers and hatchets tried to break down the door, but they couldn’t get through it. They retreated, then attacked again. They shot out the windows but didn’t hit anybody inside. Two Luddites were shot dead by the guards.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">午夜刚过，卢德分子向工厂进军。他们成功地抓住了哨兵，并且用斧头破门而入。在工厂里，一条狗开始吠叫。卡特赖特醒来，叫醒了守卫，他们开始从二楼开枪。拿着大锤和斧头的卢德分子试图破门而入，但他们无法通过。他们退却了，然后再次进攻。他们向窗外开枪，但没有击中里面的人。两名卢德分子被守卫击毙。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Eventually, the Luddites retreated. The battle was over; the Luddites lost.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最终，卢德分子退却了。战斗结束了；卢德分子输了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hundreds of people attended the funeral of one of the dead Luddites. (The other was buried in secret to prevent public mourning.) More troops were sent to the area, but for a long time no trial resulted. For months, nobody would say who was at the attack on the mill. In other towns, attacks continued. One mill owner who had said he wanted to “ride up to his saddle girths in Luddite blood” was shot dead in the street.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">数百人参加了其中一名死亡的卢德分子的葬礼。(更多的军队被派往该地区，但在很长一段时间内没有任何审判结果。几个月来，没有人愿意说谁参与了对工厂的袭击。在其他城镇，袭击仍在继续。一位曾说过要“用卢德分子的血染红他的马鞍”的工厂主被枪杀在街上。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Eventually, the government started making arrests. About sixty Luddites were thrown into a castle’s jail. There was a quick trial, and fourteen Luddites were sentenced to death, including eight of the men who had attacked Cartwright’s mill. The scaffold was built twice as high as usual so more people could see the condemned Luddites hang.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最后，政府开始进行逮捕。约有 60 名卢德分子被扔进了城堡的监狱。很快进行了审判，14 名卢德分子被判处死刑，其中包括袭击卡特赖特工厂的 8 人。为了让更多的人看到被判刑的卢德分子被绞死，脚手架被建得比平时高了一倍。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Ned Ludd popped up here and there for a little while longer. But that was basically the end of the Luddites. The last we hear from them is in a brief apocalyptic letter in 1817, suggesting a big, climactic finish was at hand: “The last die will be cast and either the Luddites or the military will have the Command.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">奈德·卢德在这里和那里又出现了一段时间。但这基本上是卢德派的终结。我们最后一次听到他们的消息是在 1817 年的一封简短的世界末日信中，暗示一个大的、高潮的结局就在眼前。“最后的死亡将被投下，要么是卢德分子，要么是军方将拥有指挥权。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">There was no big, climactic finish. The military had the command. The Luddites disappeared. Within a few decades, nobody spun or wove or cropped cloth by hand anymore. That world where cloth workers had St. Mondays and five-pound notes in their hats at the pub was gone.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">没有大的、高潮性的结局。军队掌握了指挥权。卢德分子消失了。在几十年内，没有人再用手纺纱、织布或裁剪布料。那个布匹工人在酒馆里戴着圣周一和五英镑的帽子的世界已经消失了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It’s tempting to shout back across history to the Luddites: “Trust  me. The machines are going to make things so much better. Your descendants will have enough to eat, and shoes on their feet, and they’ll be able to take vacations and won’t even have to work much until they’re eighteen years old. Everyone will get richer. Everyone will have more money.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们很想在历史上向那些“卢德分子”喊话：“相信我。机器会让事情变得更好。你们的后代将有足够的食物，脚上有鞋子，他们将能够休假，甚至在 18 岁之前都不必工作。每个人都会变得更富有。每个人都会有更多的钱。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">But for the Luddites, things didn’t get better. Things didn’t even get better for their kids. For the whole first half of the nineteenth century, as England was building the first modern industrial economy on the planet, and productivity was going through the roof, average wages for workers barely budged. Factory owners got rich. Workers who were good at building factories or repairing machines did pretty well. But it was a bad time to be a skilled artisan whose job could be done by a machine. The Luddites who destroyed machines were not deluded. They didn’t have the right to vote or to form unions, so they pursued their economic self-interest by destroying machines. One historian called it “collective bargaining by riot.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是对于卢德分子来说，事情并没有变好。对他们的孩子来说，事情甚至没有得到改善。在整个十九世纪上半叶，当英国正在建立地球上第一个现代工业经济，生产力不断提高时，工人的平均工资几乎没有变化。工厂主发财了。擅长建造工厂或修理机器的工人做得很好。但是，对于那些工作可以由机器完成的熟练工匠来说，这是一个糟糕的时代。破坏机器的卢德分子并没有被蒙蔽。他们没有投票权，也没有组建工会的权利，所以他们通过破坏机器来追求自己的经济利益。一位历史学家称其为“通过暴动进行集体谈判”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">We are living in the middle of a second machine age. It’s computers and software now, not weaving machines. But some of the same things are happening. People talk about the rise of the 1 percent. About how income for ordinary people is stagnant. Part of that is caused by technological change.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们正生活在第二个机器时代的中间。现在是计算机和软件，而不是织布机。但一些相同的事情正在发生。人们谈论 1% 的人的崛起。关于普通人的收入是如何停滞不前的。这其中有一部分是由技术变革造成的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The traditional economist’s response to this is: these problems are temporary. Technology means everyone can have more money in the long run. But one thing the Luddites have to teach us is the long run can be really, really long.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">传统经济学家对此的回应是：这些问题是暂时的。技术意味着从长远来看，每个人都可以拥有更多的钱。但是，卢德分子要告诉我们的一件事是，长期可以非常、非常长。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-38">The Gold Standard: A Love Story 金本位：一个爱情故事</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">Gold is an atom. It has 79 protons. It’s created when neutron stars collide. It existed for billions of years before the first person was born, and it will continue to exist for billions of years after the last person is dead. Gold is not a fiction, it isn’t subjective, and it isn’t some made-up thing.</p>

<p class="noindent">黄金是一个原子。它有 79 个质子。它是在中子星碰撞时产生的。在第一个人出生之前，它已经存在了几十亿年，而且在最后一个人死后，它还会继续存在几十亿年。黄金不是虚构的，它不是主观的，也不是一些捏造的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the dream of gold as money: natural, objective, eternal money, money without human foolishness, money without government. In the nineteenth century, when belief in free markets spread across the Western world, politicians and bankers and intellectuals fell in love with the gold standard. They dreamed of gold as money that flowed naturally around the world like water.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这就是黄金作为货币的梦想：自然、客观、永恒的货币，没有人类愚昧的货币，没有政府的货币。在十九世纪，当对自由市场的信念在西方世界蔓延时，政治家、银行家和知识分子都爱上了金本位。他们梦想着黄金作为货币，像水一样自然地流向世界各地。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It did not end well.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">结果并不理想。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Start with David Hume, the eighteenth-century Scottish skeptic of everything, an atheist at a time when that was a truly shocking thing to be, a philosopher and historian who got a striking number of things about the world right. His toy model of how money worked became etched in the brains of the people who ran the world and loved the gold standard. Hume was known as the Great Infidel  for his religious views, but he created an orthodoxy of money that lasted for generations.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">从大卫·休谟（David Hume）开始，这位十八世纪的苏格兰人对一切事物都持怀疑态度，在那个时代，他是一位无神论者，这确实是一件令人震惊的事情，他是一位哲学家和历史学家，对世界的许多事情都做得很正确。他关于货币如何运作的玩具模型在管理世界和热爱金本位的人们的大脑中留下了深刻的印象。休谟因其宗教观点而被称为大异教徒，但他创造的货币正统观念却持续了几代人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Here’s how countries thought about money and wealth when Hume came on the scene: gold (and silver) are wealth. So if we want our nation to be wealthy, we should pile up as much gold as we can. The way to do this is to run a trade surplus&mdash;sell more stuff to other countries than they sell to us. That way, more gold will come into the country than will leave it. Our pile of money will get bigger. We’ll be richer. To make this happen, we should limit imports (quotas) or put high taxes on them (tariffs). If this argument sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the way some contemporary politicians talk about trade.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">休谟出场时，各国是这样看待货币和财富的：黄金（和白银）是财富。因此，如果我们想让我们的国家富裕起来，我们应该尽可能多地堆积黄金。做到这一点的方法是保持贸易顺差 —— 卖给其他国家的东西比他们卖给我们的多。这样一来，进入国家的黄金会比离开国家的多。我们的钱堆会变得更大。我们会更富有。为了实现这一目标，我们应该限制进口（配额）或对进口征收高额税（关税）。如果这个论点听起来很熟悉，那是因为它是当代一些政治家谈论贸易的方式。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This, Hume said, was all wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">休谟说，这都是错误的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hume used a thought experiment to make his case. Say four-fifths of the gold and silver in Great Britain disappeared overnight. Poof! What happens next? Farmers keep growing wheat. Workers keep weaving cloth and digging coal. And now, because gold and silver are scarcer, each piece of gold and silver&mdash;each coin&mdash;becomes four times as valuable. If it used to take four pieces of silver to buy a bushel of wheat or to pay a week’s wages, now it only takes one piece of silver.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">休谟用一个思想实验来说明他的观点。假设英国五分之四的黄金和白银在一夜之间消失了。噗! 接下来会发生什么？农民们继续种植小麦。工人继续织布和挖煤。而现在，由于金银越来越少，每块金银 —— 每枚硬币 —— 变得四倍珍贵。如果以前买一蒲式耳小麦或支付一个星期的工资需要四块银子，现在只需要一块银子。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Within Britain, nothing has really changed in relative terms&mdash;a week’s wages can still buy a bushel of wheat. In the rest of the world, though, stuff from England suddenly seems super cheap. The Spanish and the French rush to buy British wheat. Now wheat is flowing out of Britain and silver is piling up. “In how little time,” Hume wrote, “must this bring back the money, which we had lost, and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在英国，相对而言没有什么变化 —— 一个星期的工资仍然可以买到一蒲式耳的小麦。但是，在世界其他地方，来自英国的东西突然显得超级便宜。西班牙和法国急于购买英国的小麦。现在，小麦正从英国流出，白银也堆积如山。休谟写道：“在多么短的时间内，这将使我们失去的货币回流，并使我们达到所有邻国的水平？”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The converse is also true. If the amount of gold and silver in Britain suddenly quadrupled, prices would rise. British consumers would rush to buy cheaper goods from France and Spain. The gold and silver would flow back out of Britain.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">反过来也是如此。如果英国的黄金和白银的数量突然翻了两番，价格就会上涨。英国消费者会急于从法国和西班牙购买更便宜的商品。黄金和白银将重新流出英国。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Whatever happens, prices and trade fall back into balance automatically in what Hume called “the common course of nature.” Trying to pile up silver and gold in one country, Hume said, is as silly as trying to make one side of the ocean higher than the other. “All water, wherever it communicates, remains always at a level.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 无论发生什么，价格和贸易在休谟所谓的“自然界的共同进程”中自动恢复平衡。休谟说，试图在一个国家堆积金银，就像试图使海洋的一边高于另一边一样愚蠢。“所有的水，无论在哪里交流，总是保持在一个水平线上。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Instead of trying to hoard gold, Hume said, countries should create the conditions for people to do good work and create things of value. Tariffs and quotas, Hume wrote, “serve to no purpose but to check industry, and rob ourselves and our neighbors of the common benefits of art and nature.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">休谟说，各国不应试图囤积黄金，而应创造条件让人们好好工作，创造有价值的东西。休谟写道，“关税和配额没有任何作用，只是为了检查工业，并剥夺我们自己和我们的邻居的艺术和自然的共同利益。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hume published this argument in a book called <em class="calibre4">Political Discourses</em>. It was wildly popular. Also, not trivially, Hume seems to have influenced his best friend, Adam Smith, who called Hume’s work on money and trade “ingenious.” In 1776, Smith published <em class="calibre4">An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em>. It was the birth of modern economics. Also, it was a pretty Humey book. A nation doesn’t get wealthy by piling on tariffs to “increase… the quantity of gold and silver,” Smith wrote. “In every country it always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">休谟在一本名为《政治讨论》（<em class="calibre4">Political Discourses</em>）的书中发表了这个论点。它受到了广泛的欢迎。另外，不无遗憾的是，休谟似乎影响了他最好的朋友亚当·斯密，他称休谟关于货币和贸易的工作是“巧妙的”。1776 年，斯密出版了《国富论》（<em class="calibre4">An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em>）。这是现代经济学的诞生。此外，这也是一本相当休谟体的书。一个国家并不是通过堆积关税来“增加黄金和白银的数量而变得富裕的”，斯密写道。“在每个国家，为了广大人民的利益，必须从卖得最便宜的人那里购买他们想要的东西。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Smith’s argument in favor of free trade is exactly what the merchants and bankers who were getting rich from trade wanted to hear. In the decades after Smith wrote, they pushed Britain to lower or eliminate many of its tariffs, to stop trying to pile up gold and silver.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">斯密支持自由贸易的论点，正是那些从贸易中发财的商人和银行家所希望听到的。在斯密写作后的几十年里，他们推动英国降低或取消了许多关税，不再试图堆积黄金和白银。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Around the same time, Britain made another key change that would help Smith’s free-trade views take over much of the world, and that would give Hume’s ideas about money more weight than ever. Parliament changed the definition of money and, without really meaning to, created the international gold standard.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大约在同一时间，英国做出了另一个关键性的改变，这将有助于斯密的自由贸易观点在世界大部分地区得到推广，这将使休谟关于货币的想法比以往任何时候都更有分量。议会改变了货币的定义，并在没有真正意义的情况下，创建了国际金本位制。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-190" class="sect1">The Case Against Gold 反对黄金的理由</h1>

<p class="noindent">Britain, like many countries, tried for a long time to create a currency based on both gold and silver. And, like many countries, it never could set the values right for gold and silver coins. In Britain’s case, the official value of silver coins was lower than their value as raw metal, so, as in John Law’s day, people kept melting down silver coins into lumps of silver and selling the lumps in Europe as scrap metal.</p>

<p class="noindent">英国和许多国家一样，在很长一段时间内试图创造一种基于黄金和白银的货币。而且，像许多国家一样，它从来没有为金币和银币设定正确的价值。在英国，银币的官方价值低于其作为原始金属的价值，因此，正如约翰·劳的时代一样，人们不断将银币融化成银块，并将银块作为废金属在欧洲出售。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1816, Parliament gave up. They declared that the British pound sterling would henceforth be defined as 123 grains of gold, and nothing else. (The grain is an ancient unit of weight based on a grain of wheat; there are 480 grains in a troy ounce.) No one knew it yet, but the era of the international gold standard had begun.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1816 年，议会放弃了。他们宣布，英国英镑今后将被定义为 123 粒黄金，而不是其他。（谷物是一种古老的重量单位，基于一粒小麦；一金衡制盎司有 480 个谷物。）还没有人知道，但国际金本位的时代已经开始了。

<p class="calibre9">Britain had the most important economy in the world at the time, and London was the center of the financial universe. Lots of countries had long struggled to figure out the right ratio between gold and silver for their money. So, one by one, other countries abandoned silver. By the late 1800s, every major economy in the world was effectively on the gold standard. In the United States, year in and year out, $20.67 got you an ounce of gold, and an ounce of gold got you $20.67. It was as basic, and as constant, as saying an hour is equal to sixty minutes, and sixty minutes are equal to an hour.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">英国拥有当时世界上最重要的经济体，而伦敦是金融界的中心。很多国家长期以来一直在努力找出黄金和白银在货币中的正确比例。因此，其他国家一个接一个地放弃了白银。到十九世纪末，世界上每个主要经济体都有效地采用了金本位制。在美国，年复一年，20.67 美元可以得到一盎司黄金，而一盎司黄金可以得到 20.67 美元。这就像说一小时等于六十分钟，六十分钟等于一小时一样，是基本的，也是不变的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Having every major economy in the world on the gold standard solved lots of economic problems. It made international trade easier. Because every country’s currency was always convertible to gold at the same rate, the relative value of different currencies stayed the same. ($4.87 bought you £1, always.) In essence the international gold standard was like having a single international currency. Along  with new technologies like steamships and railroads and the telegraph, the gold standard helped propel the first great wave of globalization. People in countries like the United States and Argentina got richer by selling stuff to Europe, and people in Europe got richer by investing in countries like the United States and Argentina. In Britain especially, tariffs came down. Gold flowed back and forth like water. Smith’s and Hume’s dreams had come true. What could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">让世界上每个主要经济体都采用金本位制解决了很多经济问题。它使国际贸易更加容易。因为每个国家的货币总是可以以相同的汇率兑换成黄金，不同货币的相对价值保持不变。(4.87 美元可以买到 1 英镑，始终如此。)从本质上讲，国际金本位制就像拥有一个单一的国际货币。与蒸汽船、铁路和电报等新技术一起，金本位制帮助推动了第一波全球化的大潮。美国和阿根廷等国家的人通过向欧洲卖东西而变得更富有，而欧洲的人通过在美国和阿根廷等国家投资而变得更富有。特别是在英国，关税下降了。黄金像水一样来回流动。斯密和休谟的梦想实现了。还有什么会出错呢？</p>

<p class="noindent">In the second half of the nineteenth century, as one country after another joined the international gold standard, the world’s economy grew faster than the world’s gold supply. The amount of stuff people wanted to buy grew faster than the amount of gold available to buy stuff. As a result, demand for gold increased, and gold got more expensive. Under the gold standard, when gold gets more expensive, the price of everything else falls.</p>

<p class="noindent">在 19 世纪下半叶，随着一个又一个国家加入国际金本位制，世界经济的增长速度超过了世界的黄金供应量。人们想要购买的东西的数量增长速度超过了可用于购买东西的黄金数量。因此，对黄金的需求增加，黄金变得更加昂贵。在金本位制下，当黄金变得更加昂贵时，其他东西的价格就会下降。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In Hume’s thought experiment, where gold disappears overnight and the price of everything falls, nothing really changes domestically because relative prices stay the same. Workers’ wages fall just the same amount as the price of goods, so everybody can buy the same amount of stuff. But Hume, in his too-beautiful-to-live thought experiment, largely left out an essential function of money: debt.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在休谟的思想实验中，黄金一夜之间消失了，所有东西的价格都下降了，在国内没有什么真正的变化，因为相对价格保持不变。工人的工资下降的幅度与商品价格下降的幅度相同，所以每个人都能买到相同数量的东西。但是，休谟在他那美丽得不能再美丽的思想实验中，基本上忽略了货币的一个基本功能：债务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">If I borrow $1,000 today, and tomorrow my paycheck and the price of everything I buy gets cut in half, I am screwed. Now I have to work twice as long to make my monthly debt payments! On the other hand, if I’m not in debt, and I have $1,000 in the bank when prices fall, I’m psyched: I can now buy twice as much stuff as I could yesterday. Deflation is bad for debtors and good for creditors.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果我今天借了 1000 美元，而明天我的工资和我买的所有东西的价格被削减了一半，我就完蛋了。现在我必须工作两倍的时间来支付我的月度债务! 另一方面，如果我没有债务，当价格下跌时，我有 1000 美元在银行，我很高兴。我现在可以买到比昨天多一倍的东西。通货紧缩对债务人不利，对债权人有利。</p>

<p class="calibre9">After the United States shifted from a gold-and-silver standard  to a gold standard in 1873, prices fell for twenty years. This was very good for rich people, whose money bought more and more stuff. It was very bad for poor people who owed money and had to keep working more and more just to make the same monthly payments. As a result, a fight broke out over what should count as money in America.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 1873 年美国从金银本位制转为金本位制后，价格下降了 20 年。这对富人来说是非常好的，他们的钱可以买到越来越多的东西。这对穷人来说是非常糟糕的，他们欠了钱，不得不继续工作，越来越多地只是为了支付相同的月供。结果，在美国爆发了一场关于什么应该算作金钱的斗争。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Farmers, who often borrow money to buy land, were getting screwed by the gold standard and the falling prices that came with it. Some supported the Greenback Party, which called for the government to print (green) paper money not backed by precious metal, as it had briefly done during the Civil War. But this was a radical position (paper that couldn’t be exchanged for gold or silver still seemed ridiculous) and never really took off.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">经常借钱买地的农民被金本位制和随之而来的价格下跌搞得很惨。一些人支持绿钞党，该党呼吁政府印制没有贵金属支持的（绿色）纸币，就像它在内战期间短暂做过的那样。但这是一个激进的立场（不能用黄金或白银兑换的纸币仍然显得很荒谬），而且从未真正实施。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So the farmers started arguing for the United States to go back to the way things used to be, when the government stood ready to trade money for either gold or silver. In that world, anybody could bring raw silver or gold to the US Mint and get coins in return. Adding silver back into the mix would mean quite simply that there was more money. This would make prices rise, which would make it easier for farmers to make their debt payments.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">于是，农民们开始争论，要求美国回到过去的方式，当时政府随时准备用钱换取黄金或白银。在那个世界里，任何人都可以把原始的白银或黄金带到美国铸币厂，并获得硬币作为回报。将白银重新加入到这个组合中，很简单，这意味着有更多的钱。这将使价格上涨，这将使农民更容易支付他们的债务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Here is a thing that always happens with money: whatever money is at a given moment comes to seem like the natural form money should take, and anything else seems like irresponsible craziness. This myopia peaked with the gold standard. After twenty years on the gold standard, people had already come to believe that the gold standard was obviously the only natural way to do money. Every civilized country does it. Who would ever consider doing money differently?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有一件事总是发生在货币上：无论什么货币在某一时刻都会被认为是货币应该采取的自然形式，而其他任何东西都像是不负责任的疯狂行为。这种近视在金本位制下达到顶峰。经过二十年的金本位制，人们已经开始相信，金本位制显然是货币的唯一自然方式。每个文明国家都是这样做的。谁会考虑用不同的方式来做货币呢？</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the 1890s, almost all Republicans and most Democrats  agreed that the United States should stay on the gold standard, and the pleas of farmers fell largely on deaf ears.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到了十九世纪 90 年代，几乎所有的共和党人和大多数民主党人都认为美国应该继续保持金本位制，而农民的恳求基本上被置若罔闻。</p>

<p class="calibre9">That changed&mdash;at least for Democrats&mdash;on July 9, 1896, when the party met in Chicago to choose a candidate for president. Late that morning, a thirty-six-year-old former congressman named William Jennings Bryan rose from his seat and walked up to the stage. He was about to give the most famous speech in presidential campaign history and launch a campaign centered on the meaning of money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这一点在 1896 年 7 月 9 日发生了变化，至少对民主党人来说是这样，当时该党在芝加哥开会选择总统候选人。那天深夜，一位名叫威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩的 36 岁前国会议员从他的座位上站起来，走上舞台。他即将发表总统竞选史上最著名的演讲，并发起一场以金钱的意义为中心的竞选活动。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bryan was known as an orator&mdash;he traveled around the country getting paid to speak&mdash;and he looked the part. “His stalwart, broad-shouldered presence fills and satisfies the eye,” one newspaper wrote. “His face, with its black eyebrows and strong features, shows the expression afar off.” One other thing about Bryan, which was not trivial given that he was going to be speaking to 20,000 people in an arena bigger than a football field, without using a microphone: he was really loud. His wife once said she was sitting inside a hotel room and could hear her husband perfectly. He was speaking three blocks away.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">布莱恩是著名的演说家 —— 他在全国各地巡回演讲，获得报酬 —— 而且他看起来很有气质。一家报纸写道：“他魁梧的身躯，宽阔的肩膀，充实和满足了人们的目光。他的脸，黑色的眉毛和强壮的五官，很远就能看清他的表情。” 关于布莱恩的另一件事，考虑到他要在一个比足球场还大的场馆里对两万人讲话，而且不使用麦克风，这不是小事：他真的很大声。他的妻子曾经说过，她坐在酒店的房间里，可以完全听到她丈夫的声音。他是在三个街区外讲话的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">That day in Chicago, facing a divided party, Bryan began speaking directly to those in the audience on the other side: the Democrats who wanted to keep America on gold.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那天在芝加哥，面对一个分裂的政党，布莱恩开始直接向观众中的另一方说话：那些想让美国保持黄金的民主党人。</p>

We say to you that you have made too limited in its application the definition of a businessman.

The miners who go 1,000 feet into the earth… and bring forth from their hiding places the precious metals… are as much businessmen as the few financial magnates who in a backroom corner the money of the world.

</div>
<p class="calibre9">In his memoirs, Bryan said this idea that the gold standard is actually bad for business&mdash;if you define business broadly&mdash;was the most important argument of the speech. But nobody remembers that part of the speech, because the speech wasn’t really an argument. It was a cross between a declaration of war and a sermon. And as he shifted roles from political debater to bellicose preacher, Bryan switched audiences. He stopped trying to convince the advocates of the gold standard and started rallying the silverites.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在他的回忆录中，布莱恩说这个关于金本位制实际上对商业不利的观点 —— 如果你对商业有广泛的定义 —— 是这次演讲中最重要的论点。但没有人记得演讲的这一部分，因为演讲并不是一个真正的论点。它是宣战和布道之间的交叉。当他从政治辩论家转变为好战的传教士时，布莱恩也转换了听众的角色。他不再试图说服金本位制的拥护者，而是开始召集白银主义者。</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">As he spoke that last line, Bryan stepped back from the podium, stretched his arms out as if he were on the cross, and stood there,  silently, for several seconds. It was a bold move, and it wasn’t clear how it would play to the room.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当他说出最后一句话时，布莱恩从讲台上退了下来，伸出双臂，就像他在十字架上一样，静静地站在那里，持续了几秒钟。这是一个大胆的举动，并不清楚它将如何在房间里发挥作用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Very well, it turned out. As Bryan walked down from the stage and into the crowd, one reporter wrote, “Everybody seemed to go mad at once.” People shouted and waved umbrellas and threw their hats across the room. Two bands started playing two different songs. Old men wept. A farmer banged on his chair and yelled, “My God! My God! My God!” The crowd lifted Bryan on their shoulders and carried him around the room. Delegations from dozens of southern and western states rushed with their banners to stand next to Bryan’s Nebraska delegation. The next day, they elected Bryan the Democratic nominee for president.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">非常好，事实证明。当布莱恩从舞台上走下来，走进人群时，一位记者写道：“每个人似乎都一下子疯了。”人们大喊大叫，挥舞着雨伞，把帽子扔到房间里。两个乐队开始演奏两首不同的歌曲。老人哭了起来。一个农民敲打着他的椅子，大喊：“我的上帝! 我的上帝！我的上帝！我的上帝！”人群把布莱恩抬到他们的肩上，带着他在房间里走动。来自南部和西部几十个州的代表团带着他们的旗帜赶来，站在布莱恩的内布拉斯加州代表团旁边。第二天，他们选举布莱恩为民主党提名的总统候选人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">William McKinley was not impressed. McKinley was the Republican nominee, and his shtick that year was giving speeches from the front porch of his house in Ohio. The day after Bryan’s nomination, two days after the “cross of gold” speech, McKinley stood up on a chair on his porch and gave his own speech to a group of Republicans who had come to see him:</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">Like Bryan, McKinley was selling morality more than any particular economic argument. But instead of Bryan’s morality of  oppression (by gold) and salvation (through silver), McKinley’s was the morality of “responsibility,” “duty,” and “honor.” Anyone of “sober and considerate judgement” would favor the “honest dollar” of gold&mdash;as opposed, implicitly, to the dishonest dollar of silver.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">和布莱恩一样，麦金利在推销道德，而不是任何特定的经济论点。但是，与布莱恩的压迫（通过黄金）和拯救（通过白银）的道德观不同，麦金利的道德观是“责任”、“义务”和“荣誉”。任何具有“清醒和深思熟虑的判断力”的人都会赞成“诚实的美元”的黄金 —— 与之相对的是不诚实的美元的白银。</p>

<p class="calibre9">If the gold standard caused falling prices and hurt borrowers, the moral logic went, it was good for savers&mdash;it made their money more valuable. It rewarded virtuous thrift and punished the slackers who lived beyond their means and had to borrow to get by.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果金本位制导致价格下跌并伤害了借款人，那么道德逻辑是，它对储蓄者有利 —— 它使他们的钱更有价值。它奖励了节俭的人，并惩罚了那些生活无度、不得不借钱度日的懒汉。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Everybody remembers Bryan’s “cross of gold” speech. Nobody remembers McKinley’s “sober and considerate judgement” speech. But somehow Bryan lost the election and McKinley won. Americans voted for McKinley’s buttoned-up America of anxiety and success, not Bryan’s biblical America of terror and deliverance.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">所有人都记得布莱恩的“黄金十字架”演讲。没有人记得麦金利的“清醒而周到的判断”的演讲。但不知何故，布莱恩在选举中败北，麦金利获胜。美国人把票投给了麦金利的焦虑和成功的保守主义美国，而不是布莱恩的恐怖和拯救的圣经式美国。</p>

<p class="calibre9">That year, there were new gold discoveries in the Klondike. Around the same time, people were figuring out better ways of extracting gold from ore. Now the supply of gold was growing faster than the world economy, and prices started rising. Under the gold standard, the world’s supply of the basic form of money is driven not by economic needs or political demands. It’s just, how much gold do miners happen to be pulling out of the ground this year? If it’s a lot, there will be a lot more money, and prices will rise. If it’s a little, prices will fall. It’s a weird way to run a currency.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那一年，在克朗代克地区有了新的黄金发现。大约在同一时间，人们正在找出从矿石中提取黄金的更好方法。现在，黄金供应的增长速度超过了世界经济，价格开始上涨。在金本位制下，世界上的基本货币形式的供应不是由经济需求或政治需求所驱动。只是，今年矿工们碰巧从地下挖出了多少黄金？如果很多，就会有更多的钱，价格也会上涨。如果是少量，价格就会下降。这是管理货币的一种奇怪方式。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1900, McKinley signed the Gold Standard Act, which formalized what had been effectively true for a generation: America was a gold-standard nation. When McKinley ran for reelection that year (again against Bryan), one of his campaign posters showed a drawing of McKinley standing on a gold coin, with the words “commerce” and “civilization” written next to him. Subtle! McKinley&mdash;and the gold standard&mdash;won again.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1900 年，麦金利签署了《金本位法》，正式确定了一代人以来的有效事实。美国是一个黄金标准的国家。当麦金利在那一年竞选连任时（再次对阵布莱恩），他的一张竞选海报显示了一幅麦金利站在金币上的图画，旁边写着“商业”和“文明”。很微妙! 麦金利 —— 和金本位 —— 再次获胜。

<h1 id="calibre_link-198" class="sect1"> The Money Illusion 货币幻觉</h1>

<p class="noindent">Irving Fisher was a Yale economist, a health-food zealot, a prohibitionist, and a fitness guru who filled a floor of his New Haven mansion with exercise equipment. He coauthored a book called <em class="calibre4">How to Live: Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science</em> , which sold half a million copies, the royalties of which Fisher gave to an organization he’d founded called the Life Extension Institute.</p>

<p class="noindent">欧文·费希尔（Irving Fisher）是耶鲁大学的经济学家、健康食品狂热者、禁酒主义者和健身大师，他在纽黑文的豪宅里摆满了运动器材。他与人合著了一本名为《如何生活》（<em class="calibre4">How to Live</em>）的书。基于现代科学的健康生活规则，这本书卖出了 50 万册，费舍尔把这些版税捐给了他创立的一个名为生命延续研究所的组织。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He invented a card filing system to organize all his projects, then patented it, then created a company called Index Visible to sell the card system, then merged his company with a bigger company and made a fortune. Fisher was a proponent of eugenics, which was widely popular at the time but is today clearly repulsive and immoral. At various times he also proposed a thirteen-month calendar, a simplified spelling system, and a new system for making maps. All of which is to say he was not only someone who wanted to understand the world but also to change it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他发明了一种卡片归档系统来组织他的所有项目，然后申请了专利，接着创建了一家名为可见指数（Index Visible）的公司来销售这种卡片系统，然后将他的公司与一家更大的公司合并，并发了大财。费舍尔是优生学的支持者，这在当时广受欢迎，但今天显然是令人厌恶和不道德的。在不同时期，他还提出了一个 13 个月的日历，一个简化的拼写系统，以及一个制作地图的新系统。所有这些都说明，他不仅是一个想了解世界的人，而且还想改变它。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the 1896 presidential campaign, Fisher was a young professor and, like pretty much every economist in America, he campaigned against Bryan. He shared the moral indignation of the pro-gold crew, but he also had a more intellectually rigorous reason to believe in the gold standard.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 1896 年的总统竞选中，费希尔是一位年轻的教授，和美国几乎所有的经济学家一样，他在竞选中反对布莱恩。他与支持金本位的人一样有道德上的愤慨，但他也有更多智力上的严格理由相信金本位。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The month after Bryan was nominated, Fisher published a book called <em class="calibre4">Appreciation and Interest</em>. He argued that when people expect prices to rise, lenders demand higher interest rates to compensate; when people expect prices to fall, interest rates go down. (So, for example, if I want to lend you money for a year at 5 percent interest, and I think inflation is going to be 2 percent, I’ll charge 7 percent interest. If I think prices are going to fall by 1 percent, I’ll charge 4 percent interest.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在布莱恩被提名后的一个月，费舍尔出版了一本名为《增值与利息》（<em class="calibre4">Appreciation and Interest</em>）的书。他认为，当人们预期价格上涨时，贷款人要求更高的利率来补偿；当人们预期价格下跌时，利率会下降。(因此，例如，如果我想以 5% 的利息借给你一年的钱，而我认为通货膨胀率将是 2%，我将收取 7% 的利息）。如果我认为价格将下降 1%，我将收取 4% 的利息。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> As a result, the real interest people pay&mdash;the interest after accounting for expected inflation or deflation&mdash;doesn’t change with rising or falling prices. In other words, Fisher suggested, steadily falling prices under the gold standard didn’t really matter. All those farmers who were complaining about their debts would have been paying higher interest rates if prices were rising instead of falling. In the end, the amount they had to work to pay their debts would have been the same whether or not silver was money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，人们支付的实际利息 —— 考虑到预期的通货膨胀或通货紧缩后的利息 —— 并不随着价格的上涨或下跌而改变。换句话说，费雪建议，在金本位制下，价格稳步下降并不重要。所有那些抱怨他们的债务的农民，如果价格上升而不是下降，他们将支付更高的利息。最后，无论白银是否是货币，他们为偿还债务而必须工作的数量都是一样的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in the years that followed, Fisher looked more closely at the data. Then he did something that famous economists (or, for that matter, people in general) almost never do: he admitted he was wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在随后的几年里，费舍尔更仔细地研究了这些数据。然后他做了一件著名经济学家（或者说，一般人）几乎从未做过的事情：他承认自己错了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fisher saw that in the real world, unlike in his models, interest rates don’t go up and down in lockstep with expected inflation and deflation. As he later wrote, in 1896 he “had not come to appreciate the evils of unstable money, nor how impossible it was for business men to provide against them through foresight alone.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费舍尔看到，在现实世界中，与他的模型不同，利率不会随着预期的通货膨胀和通货紧缩而上升和下降。正如他后来所写的那样，在 1896 年，他 “还没有意识到不稳定的货币的弊端，也没有意识到商人不可能仅仅通过预见性来防范这些弊端。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fisher became obsessed with the way changes in the value of the dollar could mess up people’s lives, and with figuring out ways to solve the problem. At his index-card company, he put his economic theories to work by tying employees’ wages to inflation and deflation. When prices went up, pay went up; when prices went down, pay went down. Employees’ inflation-adjusted pay stayed the same. (Raises were handled separately.) So rational!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费舍尔对美元价值的变化可能会扰乱人们的生活，以及找出解决问题的方法而着了迷。在他的索引卡公司，他把他的经济理论用于工作，把员工的工资与通货膨胀和通货紧缩联系起来。当价格上涨时，工资上涨；当价格下跌时，工资下跌。员工的通胀调整后的工资保持不变。(加薪是单独处理的。）太理性了！</p>

<p class="calibre9">“As long as the cost of living was getting higher, the Index Visible employees welcomed the swelling contents of their ‘high Cost of Living’ pay envelopes,” Fisher wrote. “They thought their wages were increasing, though it was carefully explained to them that their real wages were merely standing still. But as soon as the cost of living fell they resented the ‘reduction’ in wages.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“只要生活成本越来越高，可见指数的员工就会欢迎他们‘高生活成本’工资信封中不断膨胀的数量”，费希尔写道。“他们认为他们的工资在增加，尽管有人向他们仔细解释，他们的实际工资只是在原地踏步。但是，一旦生活费用下降，他们就会对工资的‘减少’感到不满。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Fisher wrote a book called <em class="calibre4">The Money Illusion</em> about this kind of thinking error. We think a dollar today is the same as a dollar a year ago. It’s not; that’s the illusion.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费舍尔写了一本叫《货币幻觉》的书，讲述了这种思维错误。我们认为今天的一美元和一年前的一美元是一样的。其实不然，这就是幻觉。</p>

<p class="calibre9">If I bought a house for $100,000 in 1975 and sold it for $400,000 in 2020, it may have felt like a windfall, but I actually lost money on the deal&mdash;$400,000 in 2020 bought less than $100,000 in 1975.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果我在 1975 年以 10 万美元买了一栋房子，在 2020 年以 40 万美元卖掉，可能会觉得是一笔意外之财，但实际上我在这笔交易上是亏损的 —— 2020 年的 40 万美元比 1975 年的 10 万美元买的少。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The movie with the biggest US box-office gross wasn’t <em class="calibre4">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> , which brought in over $900 million in 2015 and 2016, but <em class="calibre4">Gone With the Wind</em> , which brought in $200 million in 1939 (because $200 million in 1939 bought far more than $900 million in 2016).</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">美国票房最高的电影不是《星球大战：原力觉醒》，它在 2015 年和 2016 年带来了超过 9 亿美元的票房，而是《随风而逝》（又译，《飘》），它在 1939 年带来了 2 亿美元（因为 1939 年的 2 亿美元远远超过 2016 年的 9 亿美元）。</p>

<p class="calibre9">If I get a pay cut of 1 percent, and prices fall by 2 percent, I’m actually getting a raise. My new salary buys more stuff than my old salary.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果我减薪 1%，而物价下跌 2%，我实际上是得到了提高。我的新工资比我的旧工资能买到更多的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But of course nobody thinks this way.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但当，显然没有人这样想。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The money illusion was especially strong under the gold standard. Indeed, the gold standard, in a way, was built on the money illusion. The whole point of the gold standard was that the value of a dollar didn’t change, right? A dollar was the same amount of gold, year in and year out. This argument made Fisher crazy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在金本位制下，货币幻觉特别强烈。事实上，在某种程度上，金本位制是建立在货币幻觉之上的。金本位制的全部意义在于，一美元的价值不会改变，对吗？一美元是相同数量的黄金，年复一年。这种说法让费舍尔发疯。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Our dollar is now simply a fixed weight of gold&mdash;a unit of weight, masquerading as a unit of value.… What good does it do us to be assured that our dollar <em class="calibre4">weighs</em> just as much as ever? Does this fact help us in the least to bear the high cost of living? What we really want to know is whether the dollar <em class="calibre4">buys</em> as much as ever.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">"我们的美元现在只是一个固定的黄金重量 —— 一个重量单位，伪装成一个价值单位…… 这对我们保证我们的美元<strong class="calibre4">重量</strong>和以前一样有什么好处？这一事实对我们承受高昂的生活费用有丝毫帮助吗？我们真正想知道的是，美元是否像以前一样<strong class="calibre4">重</strong>？</p>

<p class="calibre9">“We tenaciously cling to the blissful assumption that our dollar never varies,” Fisher wrote. “We seem to like not only, as Barnum said, to be humbugged, but to humbug ourselves.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我们顽强地坚持着我们的美元永远不会变化的幸福假设”，费舍尔写道。“我们似乎不仅像巴纳姆所说的那样，喜欢被欺骗，而且喜欢欺骗自己。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Even when people saw through the money illusion, Fisher realized, the dollar was subject to swings in value that no one could predict.  These unexpected swings, when prices rose or fell across the board, arbitrarily shifted huge sums of money between lenders and borrowers. This wasn’t only unfair; it was terrible for the economy. Any perfectly good business&mdash;the best-run farm, the most honest bank, the most efficient factory&mdash;could go bust just by getting unlucky and falling on the wrong side of inflation or deflation. To Fisher, a dollar that varied unpredictably in value from year to year was as absurd and as outdated as a minute that varied in length from year to year.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">即使人们看穿了金钱的假象，费舍尔也意识到，美元的价值波动是没有人能够预测的。 当价格全面上涨或下跌时，这些意外的波动在贷款人和借款人之间任意地转移了大量的资金。这不仅不公平，而且对经济也很糟糕。任何完美的企业，包括经营最好的农场、最诚实的银行、最高效的工厂，都可能因为不走运而倒在通货膨胀或通货紧缩的一边而破产。对费舍尔来说，每年都有不可预测的价值变化的美元，就像每年都有不同长度的一分钟一样，是荒谬和过时的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The solution, Fisher thought, was obvious: redefine the meaning of money. Instead of defining the dollar as a fixed amount of gold, define it as a fixed basket of stuff. “We want a dollar which will always buy the same aggregate quantity of bread, butter, beef, bacon, beans, sugar, clothing, fuel, and the other essential things for which we spend it,” he wrote. Fisher’s idea was brilliant&mdash;and very close to the way the dollar works today.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费雪认为，解决方案是显而易见的：重新定义货币的含义。与其把美元定义为固定数量的黄金，不如把它定义为一篮子固定的东西。他写道：“我们想要一种美元，它能永远买到相同总量的面包、黄油、牛肉、熏肉、豆子、糖、衣服、燃料，以及其他我们花钱买的基本东西。”费舍尔的想法非常聪明，而且非常接近今天美元的运作方式。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But getting from the gold dollar to Fisher’s new, stable dollar was tricky. As he wrote much later, if he had just come out and suggested cutting the dollar’s link to gold, he “would have been hooted down.” So Fisher proposed an overly complicated, impossible-to-execute idea that involved frequently changing the gold content of the dollar so that the price of everything else would stay the same. If prices rose, the government would redefine the dollar to be worth a little less gold. That would bring prices back down. And vice versa. It was a sort of pretend gold standard.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，从黄金美元到费希尔的新的稳定美元是很棘手的。正如他后来所写的那样，如果他直接站出来建议切断美元与黄金的联系，他“就会被叫倒”。因此，费舍尔提出了一个过于复杂、不可能执行的想法，即经常改变美元的黄金含量，以便其他东西的价格保持不变。如果价格上涨，政府将重新定义美元，使其价值减少一点黄金。这将使价格回落。反之亦然。这是一种假装的金本位制。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fisher being Fisher, he pitched this idea everywhere he could. Also, Fisher being Fisher, he kept track of all the pitching: “99 addresses, besides 37 letters to the press, and 161 special articles, as well as 9 testimonies at hearings held by government bodies and 12 privately printed circulars, together with 13 books bearing on the subject.” He created a “Stable Money League” to push for his  policies, and on New Year’s Eve of 1920, Fisher and a few other stable-money true believers went to the Washington Monument, where, he wrote, “we ushered in the New Year by dedicating ourselves to the new movement.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费舍尔就是费舍尔，他把这个想法推销给了所有他能推销的地方。另外，费舍尔就是费舍尔，他记录了所有的投稿：“99 个地址，除了 37 封给媒体的信，还有 161 篇特别文章，以及在政府机构举行的听证会上的 9 份证词和 12 份私人印刷的通告，还有 13 本关于这个问题的书。”他创建了一个“稳定货币联盟”来推动他的政策，在 1920 年的新年前夕，费舍尔和其他一些稳定货币的忠实信徒去了华盛顿纪念碑，他写道，“我们通过为新运动奉献自己来迎接新年。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">At the time, people didn’t talk about inflation the way we do today. They talked about the high cost of living, but usually in a vague, qualitative way. They thought of the prices of particular goods increasing, but not of some aggregate, quantifiable price level. So Fisher spent years analyzing different methods for calculating price indexes. He even started a company to sell the index numbers to newspapers, which started printing them every week.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时，人们并没有像我们今天这样谈论通货膨胀。他们谈论的是高额的生活费用，但通常是以一种模糊的、定性的方式。他们想到的是特定商品的价格上涨，但不是一些总的、可量化的价格水平。因此，费希尔花了数年时间分析计算价格指数的不同方法。他甚至成立了一家公司，向报纸出售指数数字，报纸开始每周印刷这些数字。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And he made a genius propaganda move. Fisher knew people thought the dollar was stable and prices varied; he wanted to convince them that widespread price changes meant the value of the dollar itself was changing. So instead of publishing a “price index,” he published a “purchasing power of money” index. Rather than saying “prices rose last week,” Fisher’s index said “the purchasing power of the dollar fell.” Mathematically, it’s just another way of saying the same thing. But the shift was essential.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">而且他做了一个天才的宣传动作。费舍尔知道人们认为美元是稳定的，而价格是变化的；他想让人们相信，广泛的价格变化意味着美元本身的价值在变化。因此，他没有公布“价格指数”，而是公布了“货币购买力”指数。费舍尔的指数不是说“上周价格上涨”，而是说“美元的购买力下降”。在数学上，这只是同一件事的另一种说法。但这种转变是至关重要的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“I had come to realize that people could not get interested in stabilizing the dollar until they saw that it was unstable,” Fisher wrote. “The index of the dollar’s purchasing power gave to several million people every Monday morning the opportunity to read of the weekly change in the dollar.” If he wanted to win people over to his movement, Fisher realized he first had to change the way they thought about money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我逐渐意识到，在人们看到美元不稳定之前，他们不可能对稳定美元感兴趣”，费希尔写道。“美元购买力的指数让几百万人在每周一早上有机会读到美元的每周变化。”如果他想赢得人们对他的运动的支持，费舍尔意识到他首先必须改变他们对金钱的看法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the boom of the 1920s, Fisher sold his index-card company for a fortune, then invested that fortune in the booming stock market and watched it grow. He spent his money on his obsessions, including $20,000 a year on propaganda for stable money, and a  full-time salary for a personal trainer and physician. The physician had invented a variation on volleyball that Fisher called “battle ball.” Fisher “had a cement court built behind the rose garden, where he ran the… members of his staff ragged at midmorning and midafternoon workouts,” his son wrote.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 20 世纪 20 年代的繁荣时期，费舍尔卖掉了他的索引卡公司，获得了一笔财富，然后将这笔财富投资于繁荣的股市，并看着它成长。他把钱花在了他的痴迷上，包括每年 2 万美元用于稳定资金的宣传，以及为私人教练和医生支付全职工资。这位医生发明了一种排球的变体，费舍尔称之为“战斗球”。费舍尔“在玫瑰园后面建了一个水泥球场，他在那里让他的…… 工作人员在上午和下午的锻炼中疲于奔命”，他的儿子写道。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fisher was a happy warrior. He believed that he and other scientists were figuring out how to solve the world’s problems. And he was confident that the new technologies of the day&mdash;radio, mass-produced consumer goods&mdash;and new, better management justified the booming stock market.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">费舍尔是一个快乐的战士。他相信，他和其他科学家正在想办法解决世界上的问题。而且他相信，当时的新技术 —— 无线电、大规模生产的消费品 —— 以及新的、更好的管理都证明了股票市场的繁荣。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In a speech on October 15, 1929, Fisher said the market had hit “a permanently high plateau.” His pronouncement was frozen in carbonite in the next day’s <em class="calibre4">New York Times</em> : “FISHER SEES STOCKS PERMANENTLY HIGH.” Fisher’s timing was exquisite. Two weeks later, the market crashed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 1929 年 10 月 15 日的一次演讲中，费舍尔说市场已经达到了“一个永久的高位”。他的宣告被冻结在第二天的《纽约时报》中："FISHER SEES STOCKS PERMANENTLY HIGH"。费舍尔的时机把握得非常好。两周后，市场崩溃了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">To the extent Fisher is remembered today, he is remembered for being spectacularly wrong about the stock market. But he was right about money. The stock market crash of 1929 was (obviously) very bad. But it was not, on its own, enough to cause the Great Depression. What turned the crash into a worldwide disaster was the gold standard and the profound instability that went with it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就今天人们对费舍尔的记忆而言，他是因为对股市的看法大错特错而被记住的。但他对金钱的看法是正确的。1929 年的股市崩溃（显然）是非常糟糕的。但它本身并不足以导致大萧条。将股灾变成世界性灾难的是金本位制和随之而来的严重的不稳定。</p>

<p class="calibre9">To be fair, it wasn’t the gold standard alone that broke the world. It was helped along by the powerful institutions that were at the center of money, and that saw themselves as the guardians of the gold standard: central banks. In the United States, that meant the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">公平地说，打破世界的并不是金本位制。它得到了处于货币中心的强大机构的帮助，这些机构将自己视为金本位的守护者：中央银行。在美国，这意味着美联储。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-26">Just Don’t Call It a Central Bank 就别叫它中央银行了罢</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">Today, the Federal Reserve is one of the most powerful institutions in the world. It can create trillions of dollars out of thin air, affecting approximately everybody who uses money anywhere on Earth.</p>

<p class="noindent">今天，美联储是世界上最强大的机构之一。它可以凭空创造出数万亿美元，影响到地球上所有使用货币的人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But when the stock market crashed in 1929, the Fed was less than twenty years old. It was a weird central bank, which at first nobody even wanted to call a central bank, because America had just spent a hundred years fighting over whether to have a central bank at all.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，当 1929 年股市崩盘时，美联储成立还不到 20 年。这是一个奇怪的中央银行，起初甚至没有人愿意称之为中央银行，因为美国刚刚花了一百年时间来争论是否要有一个中央银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The story of that fight is the story of figuring out how to do money in a democracy. What should the government do and what should be left to the free market? Who gets to profit and who gets bailed out? And perhaps most fundamentally: Who gets to print money?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那场斗争的故事就是弄清楚如何在民主制度下处理钱的故事。政府应该做什么，什么应该留给自由市场？谁能获利，谁能得到救助？也许最根本的是：谁可以印钱？谁可以印钱？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The story starts a century before the Fed was founded, when the second most powerful person in America (a banker) went to war with the most powerful person in America (the president) over a central bank that no one quite knew was a central bank.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">故事开始于美联储成立前的一个世纪，当时美国第二大权贵（一个银行家）与美国最有权势的人（总统）为一个没有人知道是中央银行的中央银行开战。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The banker was Nicholas Biddle. He was a boy genius who grew up in Philadelphia and graduated first in his class at Princeton  at age fifteen, in 1801. Like a lot of people who finish college and don’t know what to do, he became a lawyer and hated it. He wrote in a letter that he saw his life reduced to “pleading the defenseless cases of vice and misfortune, and then dying like a mushroom on the soil which had seen me grow.” As side hustles, he ran a literary magazine and edited the journals of William Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这位银行家是尼古拉斯·比德尔。他是一个在费城长大的天才少年，1801 年在普林斯顿大学 15 岁时以全班第一名的成绩毕业。就像很多人在完成大学学业后不知道该做什么一样，他成为了一名律师，并讨厌它。他在一封信中写道，他看到自己的生活沦为“为罪恶和不幸的无助案件辩护，然后像蘑菇一样死在见证我成长的土壤上”。作为副业，他经营着一本文学杂志，并编辑了刘易斯和克拉克的日记。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When Biddle was twenty-four, he was elected to the Pennsylvania state legislature. Fighting about banking and money was America’s national pastime in the early nineteenth century (baseball hadn’t been invented yet), and Biddle jumped into the middle of it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当比德尔 24 岁时，他被选入宾夕法尼亚州的立法机关。在十九世纪初，关于银行和金钱的斗争是美国的全国性消遣活动（当时还没有发明棒球），而比德尔跳进了其中。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The idea of the government printing money was so ridiculous as to be out of the question. During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress had printed paper money to pay for the war, and then printed some more, and some more, and soon it had become worth almost nothing. The standard source of paper money was private banks, which were granted charters by state governments. Each bank printed its own paper money, redeemable on demand at the bank for silver or gold. Everybody agreed that was okay.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">政府印钱的想法是如此的荒谬，以至于不可能。在美国革命期间，大陆会议印制了纸币来支付战争费用，然后又印了一些，再印一些，很快就变得几乎一文不值。纸币的标准来源是私人银行，它们由州政府授予特许权。每家银行都印制了自己的纸币，可按要求在银行兑换成白银或黄金。每个人都认为这是好的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The fight&mdash;the endlessly recurring power-and-money-in-America fight&mdash;was over whether Congress should allow the creation of a single, national bank. Certainly it would be convenient. The bank could print paper money for people to use across the whole country, and the government could use the bank to easily move money from state to state. But a single, national bank would also be a huge concentration of power in private hands, and there was a debate over whether the Constitution even allowed for a national bank. (James Madison, the father of the Constitution, seemed to go back and forth on the issue.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这场无休止的美国权力与金钱之争，是关于国会是否应该允许建立一个单一的国家银行。当然，这将是很方便的。银行可以印制纸币供全国人民使用，政府可以利用银行在各州之间方便地转移资金。但是，一个单一的国家银行也将是一个巨大的权力集中在私人手中，而且对于宪法是否允许国家银行的存在也有争论。宪法之父詹姆斯·麦迪逊（James Madison）似乎在这个问题上反反复复。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Congress created a national bank, then killed it twenty years  later, then created a second national bank. It was called, reasonably enough, the Second Bank of the United States. The Second Bank had a bit of a rough start&mdash;specifically, a bunch of people who worked for the bank stole money. Also the bank’s policies helped cause a massive financial crisis in 1819. That year, President Monroe appointed Nicholas Biddle a director of the bank. Four years later, Biddle’s fellow directors picked him to be the bank’s president.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">国会创建了一家国家银行，然后在二十年后将其扼杀，接着又创建了第二家国家银行。它被合理地称为“美国第二银行”。第二银行的起步有点不顺利，具体来说，一群为银行工作的人偷了钱。此外，该银行的政策还帮助造成了 1819 年的大规模金融危机。这一年，门罗总统任命尼古拉斯·比德尔为该银行的董事。四年后，比德尔的同事们选择他作为银行的总裁。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It’s tough to overstate how powerful the president of the bank was. Imagine if, today, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve was also the CEO of JPMorgan Chase&mdash;and JPMorgan Chase was bigger than Apple, Google, and ExxonMobil combined. Being president of the Second Bank of the United States was sort of like that. It was the second most powerful job in America. Fortunately for America, Biddle was really good at the job.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行总裁的权力有多大，怎么说都不过分。想象一下，如果今天美联储主席也是摩根大通的首席执行官 —— 而摩根大通比苹果、谷歌和埃克森美孚加起来还要大。作为美国第二银行的总裁有点像这样。这是美国第二大权力的工作。对美国来说，幸运的是，比德尔真的很擅长这项工作。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the time Biddle became president of the bank, there were around 250 state banks scattered around the country. All of them made loans and issued their own paper money. Like banks in all times, these banks sometimes got out of control&mdash;they started lending more and more money to riskier and riskier borrowers. When a bank loaned out too much money or suddenly saw a bunch of loans go bad, it might find itself unable to redeem its paper money for gold. This was, of course, bad for the people who held the paper money, but it was bad for the local economy more generally. When the value of a dollar became unclear, when credit froze up, it became much harder to do business.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当比德尔成为银行总裁时，大约有 250 家州立银行散布在全国各地。它们都提供贷款并发行自己的纸币。像所有时代的银行一样，这些银行有时会失去控制，他们开始把越来越多的钱借给风险越来越高的借款人。当一家银行贷出了太多的钱，或者突然看到一堆贷款变坏，它可能会发现自己无法用黄金赎回其纸币。当然，这对持有纸币的人是不利的，但对当地的经济也是不利的。当一美元的价值变得不明确时，当信贷冻结时，做生意变得更加困难。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Biddle guided the Second Bank of the United States into a new role. It became a regulator of the state banks, and of the banking system more generally, to try to prevent these violent swings in lending by the state banks. He told Congress he saw it as the Bank’s duty “to keep the State banks within proper limits; to make them shape their business according to their means.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比德尔引导美国第二银行进入一个新角色。它成为各州银行的监管者，以及更普遍的银行系统的监管者，以试图防止各州银行在贷款方面的剧烈波动。他告诉国会，他认为银行的职责是“将各州银行控制在适当的范围内；使它们根据自己的能力开展业务”。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The government still accepted state banknotes in payment for things like customs duties and land purchases (there was no income tax at the time). As part of its role as banker to the federal government, the Bank allowed people to make those payments at its branches. Accumulating state banknotes gave the Bank power to rein in any state bank by turning in the notes and demanding that the bank pay out gold or silver, or sign over loans the banks had issued.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 政府仍然接受州政府的纸币，用于支付关税和土地购买等事项（当时没有所得税）。作为联邦政府的银行角色的一部分，银行允许人们在其分支机构进行这些付款。累积的州政府钞票使银行有权控制任何州政府银行，方法是上交这些钞票并要求银行支付黄金或白银，或签署银行发放的贷款。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Biddle also used the Bank to buffer swings in international trade, accumulating gold when it flowed into the country, and dispersing it to state banks at moments when gold was rushing out of the country and becoming harder for the banks to come by.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比德尔还利用银行来缓冲国际贸易的波动，在黄金流入该国时积累黄金，并在黄金涌出该国、银行越来越难在得到黄金时将其分散到各州银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He was unambiguously successful. People came to trust banks more, the United States finally had an integrated financial system, and the era was both prosperous and stable.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他无疑是成功的。人们开始更加信任银行，美国终于有了一个综合的金融体系，这个时代既繁荣又稳定。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The idea that you should use a bank to regulate other banks, and indeed to regulate the flow of money itself throughout an economy, is obvious today. The United States and every other major country have central banks to do exactly that. But the idea isn’t obvious in the abstract, and it wasn’t obvious in the 1820s. The Bank of England had existed for more than one hundred years, but people were still arguing over what its responsibilities were. Was it just a private bank? Did it have some duty to the nation?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">你应该用一家银行来监管其他银行，甚至是监管整个经济中的货币流动本身，这种想法在今天是显而易见的。美国和其他每个主要国家都有中央银行来做这件事。但这个想法在抽象上并不明显，而且在十九世纪 20 年代也不明显。英格兰银行已经存在了一百多年，但人们仍然在争论它的责任是什么。它只是一个私人银行吗？它对国家有什么责任吗？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The term “central bank” didn’t even exist yet, but Biddle was ahead of his time. One modern financial historian called Biddle “the world’s first self-conscious central banker”&mdash;the first person to run a central bank with a belief that his responsibilities weren’t just to his shareholders’ money, but to the nation’s money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“中央银行”这个词甚至还不存在，但比德尔领先于他的时代。一位现代金融历史学家称比德尔是“世界上第一个有自我意识的中央银行家” —— 第一个经营中央银行的人，他相信自己的责任不仅仅是对股东的钱，而是对国家的钱。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-209" class="sect1"> The President Who Hated Banks 憎恨银行的总统</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 1828, when Biddle was at the peak of his powers, Andrew Jackson was elected president. Jackson was the opposite of Nicholas Biddle.</p>

<p class="noindent">1828 年，当比德尔处于权力的顶峰时，安德鲁·杰克逊当选为总统。杰克逊与尼古拉斯·比德尔恰恰相反。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Jackson went off to fight in the Revolutionary War at age thirteen, was an orphan at fifteen, and grew up to become a frontiersman and a general. Biddle edited a literary magazine; Jackson killed a man in a duel. Biddle got famous for making a speech; Jackson got famous for defeating the British in the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Biddle edited the journals of Lewis and Clark; Jackson was famous in his lifetime and is notorious today for his slaughter of Native Americans. Biddle learned to control the nation’s paper money; Jackson learned to hate paper money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">杰克逊 13 岁就去参加革命战争，15 岁就成了孤儿，长大后成为一名边疆战士和一名将军。比德尔编辑了一本文学杂志；杰克逊在一次决斗中杀死了一个人。比德尔因发表演讲而成名；杰克逊因在 1812 年战争的新奥尔良战役中击败英国人而成名。比德尔编辑了刘易斯和克拉克的日记；杰克逊生前很有名，今天却因屠杀美国原住民而臭名昭著。比德尔学会了控制国家的纸币；杰克逊学会了讨厌纸币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the time Jackson was eighteen he owned land in Tennessee and was running a store with his brother-in-law. On a business trip to Philadelphia, he sold some land on credit to a merchant, then used that credit to buy stuff for the store (roughly equivalent to taking a personal check from the merchant, then endorsing it over to buy the stuff). The merchant wasn’t good for the money, and Jackson wound up on the hook. He had to sell the store to pay off the creditors. After that, Jackson didn’t like debt, or banks, or paper money. He thought money was silver and gold coins, and everything else was a scheme cooked up by bankers to rip people off.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在杰克逊 18 岁时，他在田纳西州拥有土地，并与他的姐夫一起经营一家商店。在去费城出差的时候，他向一个商人赊销了一些土地，然后用这笔赊销为商店买东西（大致相当于从商人那里拿了一张个人支票，然后背书买东西）。那位商人对钱不感兴趣，而杰克逊却背上了债务。他不得不卖掉商店来偿还债权人的钱。此后，杰克逊不喜欢债务，不喜欢银行，也不喜欢纸币。他认为钱是银币和金币，其他的都是银行家编造出来骗人的计划。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Jackson was elected president in 1828. In 1829, when Biddle paid a courtesy call to the White House, Jackson told him, “I do not dislike your bank any more than all banks.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">杰克逊于 1828 年当选总统。1829 年，当比德尔礼节性地拜访白宫时，杰克逊告诉他：“我不止讨厌你的银行，我讨厌所有银行。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">This may have been a lie. Jackson’s general vibe was that he was a man of the people, opposed to East Coast elites and wary of federal power. The Bank of the United States was all of that rolled into one:  the federal government granting special privileges to rich bankers who used those privileges to get even richer. To Jackson, it was obvious that such a massive concentration of power in a private company was undemocratic&mdash;“dangerous to our liberties,” in his words.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这可能是一个谎言。杰克逊的总体感觉是，他是一个人民的人，反对东海岸的精英，对联邦权力保持警惕。美国银行是所有这些的综合体：联邦政府给予富有的银行家特殊的特权，这些银行家利用这些特权变得更加富有。对杰克逊来说，如此大规模地将权力集中在一家私人公司显然是不民主的，用他的话说是“对我们的自由构成威胁”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At the time, companies were created by special permission of lawmakers and were given finite charters; if lawmakers didn’t like a company, they could kill it by letting the charter expire. The Bank of the United States had a twenty-year charter that was set to expire in 1836. Biddle wanted to get the charter renewed before Jackson got reelected; Congress sided with Biddle and passed a bill to recharter the Bank. Biddle showed up on the floor of the House, then threw a party nearby to celebrate.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时，公司是通过立法者的特别许可创建的，并被赋予有限的特许权；如果立法者不喜欢一家公司，他们可以通过让特许权到期来杀死它。美国银行有一个为期 20 年的章程，将于 1836 年到期。比德尔想在杰克逊连任之前延长特许权；国会支持比德尔，并通过了一项重新授予银行特许权的法案。比德尔出现在众议院，然后在附近开了一个派对以示庆祝。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“They feasted high and drank toasts and made speeches, and celebrated the victory,” Jackson’s attorney general, Roger Taney, wrote later, “taking pains to make their rejoicing sufficiently vociferous to be heard in the streets and sufficiently public to make sure that it would reach the ears of the President. And after enjoying his triumph Mr. Biddle left Washington without deigning to pay the President the ordinary visit of etiquette. It was treated as his victory: or rather the certain harbinger of Genl. Jackson’s overthrow.” In other words, in Taney’s telling, that party was Biddle’s screw you to Jackson.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“他们大快朵颐，饮酒作乐，发表演讲，庆祝胜利”，杰克逊的司法部长罗杰·塔尼后来写道，“不遗余力地使他们的欢呼声足以在街上听到，也足够公开，以确保它能传到总统的耳朵里。在享受了他的胜利之后，比德尔先生离开了华盛顿，没有向总统进行普通的礼节性拜访。这被视为他的胜利：或者说是杰克逊将军被推翻的必然预兆”。换句话说，在坦尼的讲述中，那场宴会是比德尔对杰克逊的一次报复。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Jackson was a brawler, and his response was typical. After the party, he said to his vice president: “The bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will kill it.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">杰克逊是个斗士，他的反应很典型。宴会结束后，他对他的副总统说。“银行，范布伦先生，正试图杀死我。但我要杀了它。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few days later Jackson vetoed the bill. He had enough support in Congress to sustain the veto: the Bank’s charter would not be renewed. Jackson won; Biddle lost. The United States wouldn’t have a central bank for more than seventy years.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几天后，杰克逊否决了该法案。他在国会有足够的支持来维持这一否决：银行的特许权将不会被延长。杰克逊赢了；比德尔输了。美国在七十多年里都没有中央银行了。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> When the charter of the Bank of the United States expired, Biddle got a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature and turned the bank into the United States Bank of Pennsylvania (the “of Pennsylvania” reads like a sad-trombone punchline). He dreamed briefly of making a comeback&mdash;of getting a new, national charter. Instead, the bank went bankrupt in 1841. Biddle died three years later, despondent.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当美国银行的特许状到期时，比德尔从宾夕法尼亚州立法机构获得了一份特许状，并将银行变成了宾夕法尼亚州美国银行（“宾夕法尼亚州”读起来像一个悲壮的打趣）。他曾短暂地梦想过东山再起，并获得新的全国性特许证。相反，该银行在 1841 年破产了。三年后，比德尔绝望地死去。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When Jackson had vetoed the Bank’s recharter, back in 1832, he had delivered the news to Congress with a high-minded veto message, written partly by Taney, his attorney general. The message attacked the Bank as a dangerous concentration of power in private hands. This was a reasonable argument! It <em class="calibre4">was</em> a profound concentration of power, and, though Biddle was a good, public-minded banker, his successor might have been a villain.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当杰克逊在 1832 年否决了银行的重新特许经营权时，他向国会传达了这个消息，其中有一部分是由他的司法部长塔尼撰写的高尚的否决信息。这份文件抨击银行是一种危险的权力集中在私人手中。这是一个合理的论点! 它<strong class="calibre4">是</strong>一种深刻的权力集中，而且，尽管比德尔是一个好的、有公共意识的银行家，他的继任者可能是一个恶棍。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Jackson also called the Bank a tool of the rich. “It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes,” the veto message said. “When the laws undertake… to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society&mdash;the farmers, mechanics, and laborers&mdash;who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">杰克逊还称该银行是富人的工具。“令人遗憾的是，富人和有权势的人常常使政府的行为屈从于他们自私的目的”，否决书说道，“当法律承诺…… 使富人更富有，强者更强大时，社会的卑微成员 —— 农民、机械师和工人 —— 既没有时间也没有办法为自己争取类似的好处，他们有权抱怨政府的不公正。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">But his veto was not a blow against the rich or against bankers in general. It was a blow against the Bank of the United States and its rich investors&mdash;and also a windfall for state banks and their rich investors. Without the Bank of the United States to hold them in check, state banks could now run wild, making more loans and printing more paper money than ever.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但他的否决并不是对富人或一般银行家的打击。它是对美国银行及其富有的投资者的打击 —— 也是对州立银行及其富有的投资者的意外收获。没有了美国银行的牵制，州立银行现在可以肆意妄为，比以往更多的贷款和印刷更多的纸币。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-213" class="sect1"> A Country with 8,370 Kinds of Money 一个流通 8,370 种货币的国家</h1>

<p class="noindent">In many parts of America in the 1840s and ’50s, anyone who wanted to could print money. Not surprisingly, lots of people wanted to.</p>

<p class="noindent">在十九世纪 40 年代和 50 年代的美国许多地方，任何人都可以印钞票。毫不奇怪，很多人都想这么做。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Until this time, if you wanted to create a bank, you had to get special permission from the state legislature. This often meant bribing half the legislators in the state (half plus one if you wanted to be sure to get your charter). Scandals ensued.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这之前，如果你想创建一家银行，你必须得到州立法机构的特别许可。这往往意味着要贿赂该州一半的立法者（如果你想确保获得特许权，则需要一半加一个）。丑闻接踵而至。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So in 1837, just after the Second Bank ceased to be a national bank, when the United States found itself without a national paper currency, states started passing laws that said anyone who followed certain rules could start a bank and print their own banknotes.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，在 1837 年，就在第二银行不再是国家银行之后，当美国发现自己没有国家纸币时，各州开始通过法律，规定任何遵守某些规则的人都可以开办银行并印刷自己的钞票。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The rules said that to print money, a bank had to buy some bonds and deposit them with the state banking regulator. (In a lot of states, these had to be government bonds, but some states let banks use railroad bonds, or even mortgages.) For every dollar of bonds the bank deposited, it could print a dollar of paper money, which it could then lend out to its customers. Anyone could walk into the bank and redeem the paper money for silver or gold coins. If the bank went bust, the state regulator could sell the bonds the bank had deposited and use the proceeds to redeem the paper money the bank had printed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">规则规定，为了印制货币，银行必须购买一些债券，并将其存放在州银行监管机构。(在很多州，这些债券必须是政府债券，但有些州允许银行使用铁路债券，甚至是抵押贷款）。) 银行每存入一美元的债券，就可以印刷一美元的纸币，然后可以借给客户。任何人都可以走进银行，将纸币兑换成银币或金币。如果银行破产了，国家监管机构可以出售银行存放的债券，并使用收益来赎回银行印刷的纸币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was called free banking, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it didn’t always work. Sometimes the bonds fell in value so that, even when they were all sold, there wasn’t enough gold and silver to redeem the paper money. And sometimes banks just didn’t follow the rules.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这被称为自由银行，也许并不令人惊讶，它并不总是有效。有时，债券的价值下降，以至于即使它们被全部售出，也没有足够的黄金和白银来赎回纸币。有时，银行就是不遵守规则。</p>

<p class="calibre9">States tried to keep banks honest by requiring them to hold a  minimum reserve of gold and silver, and sending inspectors around to check on the banks. In Michigan, bankers responded by posting spies on the roads. The spies would alert the local banker when an inspector was coming so the banker could scramble to get some gold before the inspector showed up. “Gold and silver flew about the country with the celerity of magic,” an oddly poetic state banking commissioner wrote in 1838. “Its sound was heard in the depths of the forest; yet, like the wind, one knew not whence it came or whither it was going.” Some banks showed state inspectors what appeared to be boxes full of gold coins, but were in fact just a thin icing of gold coins on top of a box full of nails.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">各州试图通过要求银行持有最低限度的黄金和白银储备，并派检查员四处检查银行来保持银行的诚实。在密歇根州，银行家们的反应是在路上派驻间谍。探子会在检查员到来时提醒当地的银行家，这样银行家就可以在检查员出现之前争先恐后地获得一些黄金。“黄金和白银以魔术般的速度在全国范围内飞舞”，一位奇怪的州银行专员在 1838 年写道。“它的声音在森林深处都能听到；然而，就像风一样，人们不知道它从哪里来，也不知道它要到哪里去。”一些银行向州检查员展示了看似装满金币的盒子，但实际上只是在装满钉子的盒子上涂了一层薄薄的金币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Not all banks were shady. Not even most banks were shady. But the notes printed by the shady banks looked as legit as the notes printed by the honest banks. And there were a lot of notes&mdash;at one point, the <em class="calibre4">Chicago Tribune</em> reported that the country had 8,370 different kinds of paper money in circulation. This created a daily absurdity.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">并不是所有的银行都是黑心的。甚至不是大多数银行都是黑心的。但黑心银行印制的纸币看起来和诚实银行印制的纸币一样合法。而且有很多纸币，有一次，《芝加哥论坛报》报道说，全国有 8,370 种不同的纸币在流通。这就造成了一种日常的荒谬。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A customer walks into a store and asks to buy a sack of flour. The customer hands the storekeeper a random piece of paper with, say, a picture of Santa Claus on it and the name of some bank hundreds of miles away in Waupun, Wisconsin, which sounds (all due respect) like a made-up name for a town. The paper with the picture of Santa Claus says $2. How does the storekeeper know whether to accept it?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一个顾客走进一家商店，要求购买一袋面粉。顾客随手递给店主一张纸，上面有圣诞老人的照片和几百英里外威斯康星州沃本市的一家银行的名字，这听起来（恕我直言）像是一个捏造的小镇的名字。有圣诞老人照片的纸上写着 2 美元，店主怎么知道是否接受呢？</p>

<p class="calibre9">He pulls out his <em class="calibre4">Thompson’s Bank Note Reporter</em> &mdash;a handy periodical that lists every bank in America, what the banks’ bills look like, and whether the bank is reliably redeeming its money for gold or silver.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他拿出他的《汤姆森银票报告》（<em class="calibre4">Thompson's Bank Note Reporter</em>）—— 一本方便的期刊，其中列出了美国的每家银行，银行的钞票是什么样子，以及银行是否可靠地将其货币兑换成黄金或白银。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The shopkeeper flips to the Wisconsin section, finds Waupun Bank&mdash;the bank is legit&mdash;and a brief description of the bank’s  two-dollar bills: “2s, Santa Claus, sleigh reindeers, houses &amp;c.” It’s real money!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">店主翻到威斯康星州部分，发现沃邦银行 —— 银行是合法的 —— 以及对该银行的两美元钞票的简要描述。“2s，圣诞老人，雪橇驯鹿，房子&amp;c.” 嗯，这是真正的钱！</p>

<p class="calibre9">The <em class="calibre4">Reporter</em> also tells the storekeeper to apply a 1 percent discount to the note (in other words, to value that $2 bill at $1.98). Discounts varied from city to city&mdash;the farther from the issuing bank, the bigger the discount, to account for the cost of returning the bill to the bank for redemption. And, of course, if there were signs that a bank was about to fail, the discount could get very large very quickly.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">记者还告诉店主对这张纸币打了 1% 的折扣（换句话说，将这张 2 美元的纸币估价为 1.98 美元）。各个城市的折扣不同，离发行银行越远，折扣越大，以考虑到将钞票送回银行赎回的成本。当然，如果有迹象表明一家银行即将倒闭，折扣可能会很快变得非常大。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Thompson also published a counterfeit detector (a world with thousands of different kinds of money is a counterfeiter’s dream come true) and a coin supplement that described all the foreign coins that circulated alongside American money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">汤普森还出版了一本假币检测器（一个拥有数千种不同货币的世界是造假者的梦想成真）和一本描述与美国货币一起流通的所有外国硬币的硬币补编。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was a world where the government set a few rules, then got out of the way&mdash;a world where there was a free market in money itself. This was by design. “The people… demanded that the right to deal in money should be as free in its exercise as that of dealing in wheat or in cotton bales,” one court wrote, upholding New York’s free banking law. It was the world Jackson’s cronies had dreamed of.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这个世界上，政府制定了一些规则，然后就不再管了；在这个世界上，货币本身是一个自由市场。这是经过设计的。“人民…… 要求交易货币的权利应该像交易小麦或棉花包一样自由行使”，一个法院写道，支持纽约的自由银行法。这就是杰克逊的亲信们所梦想的世界。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Here’s what a trip from Kentucky to Virginia was like in this world, according to the journals of one traveler:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">根据一位旅行者的日记，从肯塔基州到弗吉尼亚州的旅行在这个世界上是什么样的：</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Started home with the Kentucky money… at Maysville, wanted Virginia money; couldn’t get it. At Wheeling exchanged $50 note, Kentucky money, for notes of the North Western Bank of Virginia; reached Fredericktown; there neither Virginia nor Kentucky money current; paid a $5 Wheeling note for breakfast and dinner; received in change two $1 notes of some Pennsylvania bank, $1 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and balance in Good Intent shinplasters [worthless paper money];  100 yards from the tavern door all notes refused except the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">带着肯塔基州的钱开始回家…… 在梅斯维尔，想要弗吉尼亚州的钱；但没有得到。在惠灵用肯塔基州的 50 美元纸币换了弗吉尼亚州西北银行的纸币；到达弗雷德里克镇；那里既没有弗吉尼亚州的钱，也没有肯塔基州的钱；为早餐和晚餐支付了一张 5 美元的惠灵纸币；收到的零钱是宾夕法尼亚州某银行的两张 1 美元纸币，巴尔的摩和俄亥俄铁路公司的 1 美元，余额是善意的假币（不值钱的纸币）；离酒馆门口 100 码的地方，除了巴尔的摩和俄亥俄铁路公司的纸币，所有纸币都被拒绝。</p>

</div>

<p class="calibre9">Finally, our hero writes, he makes it back across the Virginia border&mdash;where he has to spend two days negotiating the exchange of his crap money for the Virginia money he needs. He loses 10 percent in the deal.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最后，我们的英雄写道，他回到了弗吉尼亚州的边境 —— 在那里，他不得不花两天时间谈判，用他的垃圾钱换取他需要的弗吉尼亚州的钱。他在交易中损失了 10%。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Free banking sounds like a nightmare&mdash;shady banks, all these different pieces of paper with different values, counterfeits, and no central bank to keep the system in check. And clearly sometimes it was a nightmare.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">自由银行听起来像是一场噩梦 —— 阴暗的银行，所有这些不同价值的纸片，伪造品，而且没有中央银行对系统进行检查。显然，有时它就是一场噩梦。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in the 1970s, as belief in free markets and skepticism of government intervention started to take off, economic historians went back and started to reexamine the free banking era. Rather than rely on anecdotes (like one unlucky traveler’s often-cited Kentucky-to-Virginia trip), they tried to look at data&mdash;at the total number of banks, the number of bank failures, and how much it typically cost people to change money. And they found that free banking wasn’t so bad!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在二十世纪 70 年代，随着对自由市场的信仰和对政府干预的怀疑开始起飞，经济史学家们回头开始重新审视自由银行时代。他们没有依靠轶事（比如一个不幸的旅行者经常被引用的肯塔基州到弗吉尼亚州的旅行），而是试图研究数据，看看银行的总数，银行倒闭的数量，以及人们换钱通常需要多少钱。他们发现，自由银行业务并不那么糟糕！</p>

<p class="calibre9">Travelers typically lost around 1 or 2 percent when they exchanged paper money, in the same ballpark as the fee I pay today when I can’t get to my bank and have to use another bank’s ATM. Also, the historians found, there weren’t actually that many shady banks.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">旅行者在兑换纸币时通常会损失 1% 或 2% 左右，与我今天因无法前往银行而不得不使用另一家银行的自动取款机所支付的费用相差无几。此外，历史学家发现，实际上并没有那么多黑心银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And the insane proliferation of paper money issued by the banks across the western frontier had its uses. It meant that settlers could borrow paper money to buy the seed and livestock and equipment they needed to go into business. As the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote, “The anarchy served the frontier far better than  a more orderly system that kept a tight hand on credit could have done.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">而银行在西部边疆疯狂发行的纸币也有其用途。这意味着定居者可以借用纸币来购买他们做生意所需的种子、牲畜和设备。正如经济学家约翰·肯尼思·加尔布雷斯（John Kenneth Galbraith）所写的那样，“这种无政府状态对边疆的作用远比一个对信贷保持严格控制的更有秩序的系统要好。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">When the Civil War broke out and the federal government needed to raise money, Abraham Lincoln’s Treasury secretary pushed new laws through Congress that created a kind of free banking for the nation. Now anyone who met certain rules could create a national bank. Crucially, for funding the war, the national banks’ paper money had to be backed by US government bonds. In order to exist, national banks had to lend money to the Union. (The Confederacy printed its own money, which became worthless when the South lost the war.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当内战爆发，联邦政府需要筹集资金时，亚伯拉罕·林肯的财政部长通过国会推动了新的法律，为国家创造了一种自由银行。现在，任何符合某些规则的人都可以创建一家国家银行。最重要的是，为了资助战争，国家银行的纸币必须有美国政府债券的支持。为了生存，国家银行必须向联邦借钱。(南方联盟印制了自己的货币，当南方战败时，这些货币变得一文不值。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A final banking bill was signed by President Lincoln on March 3, 1865&mdash;“the day before his second inaugural, a month before the fall of Richmond, six weeks before his murder,” the economic historian Bray Hammond wrote. The bill put a 10 percent tax on paper money issued by state banks. Its intent was to tax state banknotes out of existence, leaving only the uniform paper money issued by national banks. It worked as intended, and soon all the money printed by state banks was gone.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1865 年 3 月 3 日，林肯总统签署了一项最后的银行法案，“在他第二次就职典礼的前一天，在里士满沦陷的前一个月，在他被谋杀的前六个星期”，经济史学家布雷·哈蒙德写道。该法案对各州银行发行的纸币征收 10% 的税。它的目的是对各州的纸币征税，使之不复存在，只留下国家银行发行的统一纸币。它如愿以偿，很快，所有由州立银行印制的钱都不见了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Civil War was the moment when people stopped saying “the United States are” and started saying “the United States is”&mdash;when it went from being a bunch of different states to being a single country. Destroying the world of thousands of different kinds of money issued by state-chartered banks and creating the world of one kind of paper money&mdash;uniform bills issued by national banks&mdash;was a small part of that shift. Money is part of what makes a country a country.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">内战是人们说“美国是…… ”时系动词不再用复数（<em>are</em>）而是用单数（<em>is</em>）的时刻；即，当它从一群不同的州变成一个单一的国家时。摧毁由各州特许银行发行的数千种不同货币的世界，创造由国家银行发行的统一纸币的世界，是这种转变的一小部分。货币是使一个国家成为一个国家的部分原因。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-219" class="sect1">Panic Attacks 恐慌发作</h1>

<p class="noindent">The paper money printed by the new national banks circulated around the country at face value. So far, so good. But because the money had to be backed by government bonds, the amount of money in circulation was limited by the amount of money the government borrowed. Every fall, when farmers needed money to hire people to harvest their crops, and buyers needed money to buy the crops, there was a shortage of money, and interest rates spiked.</p>

<p class="noindent">新的国家银行印制的纸币按面值在全国流通。到目前为止，一切都很好。但是，由于这些钱必须有政府债券的支持，流通中的货币数量受到政府借贷金额的限制。每年秋天，当农民需要钱来雇人收割庄稼，而买家需要钱来购买庄稼时，就会出现货币短缺，利率飙升。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There was another problem, less frequent but more severe, with money in America: massive financial crises. A trigger came every 10 years or so&mdash;a big bank would fail, or a speculative bubble would burst&mdash;and everybody would rush to turn the money in their bank account into paper money, or to turn their paper money into gold. And, as always, even healthy banks didn’t have enough money to withstand a run. The economy would collapse. Millions of people would lose their jobs. Aptly, the crises were called panics.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在美国，货币还有另一个问题，不那么频繁，但更严重：大规模的金融危机。每隔 10 年左右就会发生一次，一家大银行倒闭，或者一个投机泡沫破灭，每个人都会急着把银行账户里的钱变成纸币，或者把纸币变成黄金。而且，像往常一样，即使是健康的银行也没有足够的钱来抵御挤兑。经济将崩溃。数百万人将失去他们的工作。恰好，这些危机被称为恐慌。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Europeans were starting to realize that a central bank&mdash;a bank with a government-granted monopoly on printing paper money, and the obligation to manage the nation’s money&mdash;could make panics less frequent and less severe. The key move was for the central bank to lend money freely to sound borrowers when everybody was panicking.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">欧洲人开始意识到，一个中央银行 —— 一个拥有政府授予的印刷纸币的垄断权，并有义务管理国家货币的银行 —— 可以使恐慌不那么频繁和严重。关键之处在于，当所有人都在恐慌时，中央银行可以自由地把钱借给健全的借款人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man,’” Walter Bagehot, a nineteenth-century editor of the <em class="calibre4">Economist</em> magazine, famously wrote. If people know that the central bank will lend to keep their bank in business tomorrow, then they won’t rush to pull their money out today. And if they don’t rush to pull their money out today, there’s no panic, no financial crisis.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“他们必须贷款给商人，给小银行家，给‘这个人和那个人’”，十九世纪《经济学家》杂志的编辑沃尔特·巴盖特（Walter Bagehot）写过一篇著名的文章。如果人们知道中央银行明天会贷款来维持银行的业务，那么他们今天就不会急着把钱取出来。如果他们今天不急着把钱取出来，就不会有恐慌，不会有金融危机。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> But America was still living in the shadow of Andrew Jackson. People hated the idea of a central bank, which they figured would be a tool of elites on Wall Street, or elites in Washington, or both, and in any case would rob from the poor and give to the rich and be a general threat to democracy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但美国仍然生活在安德鲁·杰克逊的阴影下。人们讨厌中央银行的想法，他们认为这将是华尔街精英的工具，或华盛顿精英的工具，或两者都是，而且在任何情况下都会劫贫济富，并对民主构成普遍威胁。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, in the fall of 1907, a copper magnate who controlled a small New York bank got into financial trouble, and a run on his bank quickly spread to other New York banks. It was the worst financial panic since Andrew Jackson’s time. It ended only after J. P. Morgan, the most influential banker in the country, locked a bunch of other bankers in his private library and told them he wouldn’t open the door until they agreed on a plan to bail each other out. Then he played solitaire and smoked cigars until they worked it out.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后，在 1907 年秋天，一个控制着纽约一家小银行的铜业大亨陷入了财务困境，对他的银行的挤兑迅速蔓延到纽约的其他银行。这是自安德鲁-杰克逊时代以来最严重的金融恐慌。直到全国最有影响力的银行家摩根（J.P. Morgan）将一群其他银行家锁在他的私人图书馆里，并告诉他们他不会开门，直到他们同意一个互相救助的计划，这场恐慌才结束。然后他玩起了单人纸牌，抽起了雪茄，直到他们解决了这个问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The bankers did come up with a plan, and it did stop the panic, but not in time to save the real economy&mdash;unemployment doubled and bankruptcies rose by half. This is what passed for central banking in America in 1907.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行家们确实想出了一个计划，也确实阻止了恐慌，但没有及时拯救实体经济 —— 失业率翻倍，破产率上升一半。这就是 1907 年美国的中央银行的情况。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Yet the panic didn’t convince Americans that they needed a central bank. Instead, one banker wrote, most people were “laying the blame for these difficulties upon the ‘selfish and reckless management of corporations,’ on ‘over-speculation,’ the ‘greed of banks’ or the wily practices of ‘Wall Street.’”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然而，这场恐慌并没有让美国人相信他们需要一个中央银行。相反，一位银行家写道，大多数人“把这些困难归咎于‘公司的自私和鲁莽的管理’，归咎于‘过度投机’，‘银行的贪婪’或‘华尔街的狡猾做法’。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">Of course banks are greedy! Of course corporations are selfish, and Wall Street is wily! Blaming a financial crisis on these qualities is like blaming a flood on the wetness of water. A twenty-first-century economist pointed out that if Wall Street greed caused financial crises, we’d have a crisis every week. The important question at the time&mdash;and, indeed, the question we should always be asking&mdash;is: How can we design a monetary system that channels  that greed and selfishness and wile toward socially useful ends, and limits the potential harm inherent in finance?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当然，银行是贪婪的! 企业当然是自私的，而华尔街是狡猾的! 把金融危机归咎于这些品质，就像把洪水归咎于水的湿润程度。一位二十一世纪的经济学家指出，如果华尔街的贪婪导致了金融危机，我们每周都会有一场危机。当时的重要问题 —— 事实上，我们应该一直问的问题 —— 是我们如何设计一个货币体系，将这种贪婪、自私和狡猾引向对社会有益的目的，并限制金融中固有的潜在危害？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Panic of 1907 did get some people thinking about these questions&mdash;notably a powerful senator named Nelson Aldrich, who was known as the King Pin. He started reading about banking and chaired a monetary commission that went off and toured Europe to see how they did money there.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1907 年的恐慌确实让一些人开始思考这些问题 —— 特别是一位名叫纳尔逊·奥尔德里奇的有权势的参议员，他被称为“太上皇”。他开始阅读有关银行业的书籍，并主持了一个货币委员会，该委员会前往欧洲考察，看看那里的货币是如何运作的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By 1910, Aldrich was convinced that America needed a central bank, or at least something central bank-ish. But he also knew that Americans wouldn’t go for it. So he did what any reasonable senator would do. He gathered a cabal of powerful bankers to go off in secret to plot a central bank that everyone agreed not to call a central bank.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到了 1910 年，奥尔德里奇确信美国需要一个中央银行，或者至少是类似中央银行的东西。但他也知道，美国人不会同意这样做。所以他做了任何有理智的参议员都会做的事。他召集了一帮有权势的银行家，秘密地去策划一个大家都同意不叫中央银行的中央银行。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-223" class="sect1">A Senator and a Bunch of Bankers Sneak Off to a Private Island to Plot a Central Bank 一位参议员和一群银行家偷偷跑到一个私人岛屿上策划建立中央银行</h1>

<p class="noindent">On a November night in 1910, a group of prominent men arrived one by one at a private railcar hooked to the back of a train in Hoboken, New Jersey. They included Senator Aldrich, three of the most powerful bankers in America, and a Harvard economist working for the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="noindent">1910 年 11 月的一个晚上，一群知名人士陆续来到新泽西州霍博肯市一辆挂在火车后面的私人轨道车。他们包括参议员奥尔德里奇、三位美国最有权势的银行家，以及一位为财政部长工作的哈佛大学经济学家。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Their trip was a secret. Aldrich had told the men to come alone, in the dark, dressed as duck hunters (complete with rifles), and to use only first names, to conceal their identities. “When I came to that car,” one of the bankers wrote decades later, “the blinds were down, and only slender threads of amber light showed the shape of  the windows. Once aboard the private car, we began to observe the taboo that had been fixed on last names. We addressed one another as Ben, Paul, Nelson, Abe.” The train started rolling south. One of the bankers had arranged for the group to stay at a fancy hunting club off the coast of Georgia that was deserted in November. Its name was a conspiracy theorist’s dream come true: Jekyll Island. Over the next week or so, the group would create a plan to transform the nature of money in America.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他们的旅行是一个秘密。奥尔德里奇让这些人在黑暗中独自前来，打扮成猎鸭人（配有步枪），并且只使用名字，以掩盖他们的身份。“当我来到那辆车前时”，其中一位银行家几十年后写道，“百叶窗已经放下，只有细长的琥珀色光线显示出车窗的形状。一旦上了私家车，我们就开始遵守被固定在姓氏上的禁忌。我们互相称呼对方为本、保罗、纳尔逊、亚伯。”火车开始向南滚动。其中一位银行家安排这群人住在佐治亚州沿海的一个高级狩猎俱乐部，该俱乐部在 11 月被遗弃。它的名字是一个阴谋论者的梦想成真 —— 杰基尔岛。在接下来的一周左右的时间里，这群人将制定一个计划来改变美国的货币性质。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Because they thought America needed a central bank, and they knew Americans were wary of both centralization and banking, the cabal cooked up a classic American compromise: a network of not-quite-central banks scattered around the country. Also, they weren’t going to be called central banks. They were going to be called “reserve associations.” They would be linked together as the Reserve Association of the United States. The reserve associations, like central banks in Europe, would be controlled by private bankers, not by government officials. And they would be able to print dollar bills, and to lend to local banks. The cabal disbursed, and Aldrich released the plan without explaining that it was cooked up in secret by a bunch of bankers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因为他们认为美国需要一个中央银行，而且他们知道美国人对中央集权和银行业都有戒心，所以阴谋家们制定了一个典型的美国式妥协：一个由分散在全国各地的不完全是中央银行的网络。此外，他们不打算被称为中央银行。它们将被称为“储备协会”。它们将被连接在一起，成为美国的储备协会。储备协会，像欧洲的中央银行一样，将由私人银行家控制，而不是由政府官员。他们将能够印刷美元钞票，并向当地银行贷款。阴谋家们支付了款项，奥尔德里奇发布了该计划，但没有解释它是由一群银行家秘密制定的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The plan still seemed like it was cooked up by a bunch of bankers. Congress argued about it. Aldrich retired. The Democrats&mdash;the party of Jackson, slayer of the Bank of the United States&mdash;won power in Congress. “The ghost of Andrew Jackson stalked before my face in the daytime and haunted my couch for nights,” wrote the Democratic congressman who pushed the bill through the House.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">该计划看起来仍然像是由一群银行家炮制的。国会对此进行了争论。奥尔德里奇退休了。民主党 —— 杰克逊的政党，美国银行的杀手 —— 在国会赢得了权力。“安德鲁·杰克逊的鬼魂白天在我面前徘徊，晚上在我的沙发上出没”，推动该法案通过众议院的民主党议员写道。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Democrats couldn’t live with a bunch of central banks controlled by private bankers. So, contrary to the cabal’s plan, the regional reserve associations&mdash;now renamed Federal Reserve Banks&mdash;would be overseen by a board of governors in Washington, whose members were appointed by the president.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">民主党人无法忍受一群由私人银行家控制的中央银行。因此，与阴谋集团的计划相反，区域储备协会 —— 现在改名为“联邦储备银行” —— 将由华盛顿的管理委员会监督，其成员由总统任命。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> America was on the gold standard, and Congress constrained the Reserve Banks’ ability to print paper money. The banks could only create $10 in paper for every $4 worth of gold they had in the vault. And, finally, profoundly, Federal Reserve notes would be “obligations of the United States”&mdash;not private money issued by private banks, but government money issued by a new, weird hybrid public-private central bank that was actually twelve different banks but was also, sort of, a central bank.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 美国实行金本位制，国会限制了储备银行印制纸币的能力。银行只能为其金库中每 4 美元的黄金创造 10 美元的纸张。最后，意义深远的是，美联储的票据将是“美国的义务” —— 不是由私人银行发行的私人货币，而是由一个新的、奇怪的公私混合中央银行发行的政府货币，该银行实际上是 12 家不同的银行，但也算是一个中央银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was a horse designed by a committee of committees, a camel of a central bank, and if it sounds kind of like a good idea and kind of like a mess, it was. For the next twenty years, the Fed provided the country with a useful currency and smoothed out the seasonal money crunches.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这是一匹由一个委员会设计的马，一个中央银行的骆驼，如果它听起来有点像一个好主意，又有点像一个烂摊子，那它就是这样。在接下来的二十年里，美联储为国家提供了有用的货币，并抚平了季节性货币紧缩的问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, in the crisis that followed the stock market crash of 1929, the fragmented Fed helped to turn what might have been an ordinary economic downturn into the worst economic catastrophe of the twentieth century.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后，在 1929 年股市崩盘后的危机中，支离破碎的美联储帮助将原本可能是普通的经济衰退变成了 20 世纪最严重的经济灾难。</p>

<p class="noindent">At the core of the gold standard was a simple rule: anyone who wanted to could walk into a Federal Reserve Bank and trade paper dollars for gold&mdash;one ounce for every $20.67. By 1933, this rule had become a problem for the Fed.</p>

<p class="noindent">金本位制的核心是一个简单的规则：任何人都可以走进联邦储备银行，用纸币换取黄金 —— 每 20.67 美元换一盎司。到 1933 年，这一规则已经成为美联储的一个问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The country was in the middle of the worst banking panic in its history. People were not only running to their banks to turn their bank deposits into paper dollars; they were running to the Fed to turn their paper dollars into gold. In early March, the panic came to New York —— then as now, the center of banking in America. And the New York Fed was about to run out of gold.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这个国家正处于历史上最严重的银行恐慌之中。人们不仅跑到银行把他们的银行存款变成了纸币；他们还跑到美联储把他们的纸币变成了黄金。3 月初，恐慌来到了纽约，当时和现在一样，这里是美国的银行业中心。而纽约联储的黄金即将耗尽。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So at around one in the morning on March 4, 1933, the head of the New York Fed showed up at the Park Avenue apartment of the governor of New York. He wanted the governor to declare a bank holiday&mdash;a weird euphemism that sounds like a cheap package vacation but actually means closing every bank in the state so people can’t pull their money out. The governor reluctantly agreed. At 2:30 a.m., he signed an order closing every bank in the state for three days.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，在 1933 年 3 月 4 日凌晨 1 点左右，纽约联储的负责人出现在纽约州长的公园大道公寓里。他想让州长宣布一个银行假日 —— 一个奇怪的委婉说法，听起来像一个廉价的套餐假期，但实际上意味着关闭该州的所有银行，这样人们就不能把钱取出来。州长很不情愿地同意了。凌晨 2 点 30 分，他签署了一项命令，将该州的所有银行关闭三天。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was happening all over the country that morning. The  governor of Illinois closed all the banks in his state. Around dawn, the governor of Pennsylvania did it (and said as he signed the order that he only had 95 cents in his pocket). Massachusetts and New Jersey closed their banks later that morning. Dozens of states had closed their banks in the previous weeks. There were no ATMs, no credit cards. So with banks closed, there was no way for most people in America to get money. That afternoon, in the middle of the worst moment in the history of money in America, with people talking about revolution and the end of capitalism, and soldiers manning machine guns in the streets of Washington, DC, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sworn in as president of the United States.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那天早上，全国各地都在发生这种情况。伊利诺伊州的州长关闭了该州的所有银行。黎明前后，宾夕法尼亚州州长也这样做了（他在签署命令时说，他的口袋里只有 95 美分）。马萨诸塞州和新泽西州在当天上午晚些时候关闭了他们的银行。在之前的几周里，有几十个州关闭了它们的银行。没有自动取款机，没有信用卡。因此，由于银行关闭，美国大多数人没有办法得到钱。那天下午，在美国货币历史上最糟糕的时刻，人们在谈论革命和资本主义的终结，士兵们在华盛顿特区的街道上架起了机枪，富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福宣誓就职美国总统。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Within months, Roosevelt would ignore the advice of his closest advisors and some of the most prominent economists in the country, destroying the very idea of money as it had existed until then, and creating the money we still use today.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在几个月内，罗斯福将无视他最亲密的顾问和该国一些最著名的经济学家的建议，摧毁了在此之前存在的货币理念，并创造了我们今天仍然使用的货币。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-228" class="sect1">How a Shortage of Money Itself Caused the Great Depression 货币短缺本身是如何导致大萧条的</h1>

<p class="noindent">Today, bank deposits in the United States and most other countries are insured by the government. That wasn’t always the case; when a bank went out of business, depositors didn’t always get their money back. So when people got even a little bit nervous about their bank, they would rush to take their money out. This was an entirely rational thing to do. But once people start rushing to take their money out, no bank can survive. Depositors’ money in the bank is never actually in the bank; it’s loaned out to borrowers. When a sociologist coined the term “self-fulfilling prophecy” in the 1940s, his first example was a run on a healthy bank.</p>

<p class="noindent">今天，美国和其他大多数国家的银行存款由政府提供保险。但情况并非总是如此；当一家银行倒闭时，储户不一定能拿回他们的钱。因此，当人们对他们的银行有一点点紧张时，他们会急着把钱取出来。这是一件完全理性的事情。但是，一旦人们开始急于把钱取出来，任何银行都无法生存。储户在银行的钱实际上从来没有在银行里；它被借给了借款人。当一位社会学家在 20 世纪 40 年代创造了“自我实现的预言”一词时，他的第一个例子是对一家健康银行的挤兑。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> One thing sure to make depositors nervous is seeing the bank in the next town over go bust. So even in good times the US banking system was like a giant circle of dominoes, with everybody looking anxiously around the circle to see if anything was wobbling. In the 1800s and early 1900s, there were massive, nationwide banking panics every ten to twenty years.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有一件事肯定会让储户紧张，那就是看到隔壁镇的银行破产。因此，即使在好的时候，美国的银行系统也像一个巨大的多米诺骨牌圈，每个人都焦急地环顾四周，看看是否有什么东西在晃动。在十九世纪和二十世纪初，每隔 10 到 20 年就会出现大规模的全国性银行恐慌。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Federal Reserve had been created in part to prevent these; it had the authority to lend to banks that were fundamentally sound but in danger of suffering a run. Loans from the Fed would allow banks to pay out all the money depositors wanted and prevent a few isolated failures from becoming a nationwide panic.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">美联储的建立部分是为了防止这种情况；它有权向那些基本健全但有可能发生挤兑的银行提供贷款。美联储的贷款将使银行能够支付储户想要的所有款项，并防止少数孤立的失败成为全国性的恐慌。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When the stock market crashed in 1929, the New York Fed did exactly what it was supposed to do: it flooded New York City banks with cheap loans. And it worked! The loans prevented a wave of bank failures, which would have made things even worse.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当 1929 年股票市场崩溃时，纽约联储完全做了它应该做的事：它用廉价贷款淹没了纽约市的银行。而且，它起了作用! 这些贷款防止了银行倒闭潮，而倒闭潮会使情况变得更糟。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Still, in 1930, unemployment continued to rise, and spending and prices continued to fall. The head of the New York Fed proposed making it easier for banks to borrow, to try to get the economy going again.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">尽管如此，在 1930 年，失业率继续上升，支出和价格继续下降。纽约联储的负责人提议让银行更容易借贷，以试图让经济再次发展。</p>

<p class="calibre9">While the mechanics are different today, the Fed still operates on the same basic principle: when the economy starts to get worse, the Fed creates money and makes it cheaper to borrow. This makes it easier for debtors to stay afloat and encourages businesses to borrow money to invest and hire people.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">虽然今天的机制不同，但美联储仍然按照相同的基本原则运作：当经济开始恶化时，美联储创造货币，使借款更便宜。这使得债务人更容易维持生计，并鼓励企业借钱投资和雇人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in 1930, most of the officials at the Federal Reserve Banks scattered around the country didn’t want to intervene. The Chicago Fed worried that putting more money into the system would encourage speculative gambling by traders rather than productive investments by businesses. The head of the Dallas Fed warned against “interference with economic trends through artificial methods.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在 1930 年，分散在全国各地的联邦储备银行的大多数官员并不想进行干预。芝加哥联储担心，将更多的钱投入系统会鼓励商人的投机赌博，而不是企业的生产性投资。达拉斯联储的负责人警告说，不要“通过人为的方法干预经济趋势。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> So the Fed sat idle, as falling prices and rising unemployment made it harder for people and businesses to pay their debts. This caused more bank failures. Through the spooky magic of fractional reserve banking, banks had made lots of loans in the 1920s and had turned a relatively small amount of gold and paper bills into a large amount of money in the form of bank deposits. In 1930, that magic ran in reverse. As people pulled their money out of banks, and banks closed, the amount of money in circulation started to fall.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 因此，美联储无所事事，因为价格下跌和失业率上升使人们和企业更难支付他们的债务。这导致了更多的银行倒闭。通过部分准备金制度的诡异魔力，银行在二十世纪 20 年代提供了大量贷款，并将相对较少的黄金和纸币变成了大量的银行存款形式的货币。在 1930 年，这种神奇的情况发生了逆转。随着人们把钱从银行撤出，银行关闭，流通中的货币量开始下降。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At the same time, people were spending less because they were terrified about the future and wanted to save everything they could. (Also, if you think prices are going to fall, it makes sense to wait to buy stuff, because stuff will be cheaper in the future.) The combination of less money in circulation and less spending caused prices to fall. Falling prices made things even worse for debtors, which meant even more people were unable to pay back their loans, which caused even more banks to fail, which meant that there was even less money in circulation. And so on.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">与此同时，人们减少了消费，因为他们对未来感到恐惧，想把所有能省的东西都省下来。(另外，如果你认为价格会下降，那么等待购买东西是有意义的，因为东西在未来会更便宜)。流通中的货币减少和消费减少，导致价格下跌。价格下跌使债务人的情况更加糟糕，这意味着更多的人无法偿还他们的贷款，这导致更多的银行倒闭，这意味着流通中的钱更少。等等。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is called a deflationary spiral. It is not nature taking its course. It is not the necessary correction for a previous bout of speculation. It is a profound, entirely preventable economic disaster caused by money itself. It was what the Fed was supposed to prevent. Instead, the Fed was about to make things worse.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这被称为通货紧缩的螺旋。这不是自然界的规律。它不是对以前的投机行为的必要修正。这是一场深刻的、完全可以预防的经济灾难，由货币本身引起。这正是美联储应该防止的。相反，美联储即将使事情变得更糟。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-231" class="sect1">Golden Handcuffs 金手铐</h1>

<p class="noindent">The international gold standard tied the world’s economies together. This was good when they rose together, but in the early ’30s, the gold standard was a weight pulling most of Europe and North America to the bottom of the ocean. Banks collapsed across both  continents. The center of the financial universe was London, and as people panicked they traded their British pounds for gold. By the fall of 1931 the Bank of England&mdash;the same bank that was started just after John Law was tried for murder, and which had by now become the most important central bank in the world&mdash;was about to run out of gold. So the Bank of England did something that was both unthinkable and the only thing it could do: it stopped giving people gold in exchange for paper money.</p>

<p class="noindent">国际金本位制将世界各国的经济捆绑在一起。当它们一起上升时，这是好事，但在 30 年代初，金本位制是一个重量，将欧洲和北美的大部分地区拉到了海底。两大洲的银行都倒闭了。金融世界的中心是伦敦，当人们惊慌失措时，他们把他们的英镑换成了黄金。到 1931 年秋天，英格兰银行(Bank of England&mdash)，也就是在约翰·劳因谋杀罪被审判后成立的银行，现在已经成为世界上最重要的中央银行 —— 即将耗尽黄金。因此，英格兰银行做了一件既匪夷所思又是它唯一能做的事情：它停止向人们提供黄金以换取纸币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People who had money in the United States looked at this and thought: <em class="calibre4">Damn! Britain invented the gold standard, and</em> they <em class="calibre4">went off it. The United States is going to follow soon.</em> So they started trading their dollars in for gold, too. In the five weeks after Britain went off the gold standard, people traded in $750 million dollars for gold from the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在美国有钱的人看了这个，就想:“该死的! 英国发明了金本位制，而他们离开了金本位制”。所以他们也开始用他们的美元换取黄金。在英国脱离金本位后的五个星期里，人们用 7.5 亿美元从美联储换取了黄金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Federal Reserve knew how to fight this gold drain: it raised interest rates. The higher interest rates are, the higher the incentive for people to keep their money in interest-bearing bank accounts, rather than turning their bank deposits into gold. The higher interest rates worked. People stopped exchanging their dollars for gold.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">美联储知道如何对抗这种黄金流失：它提高利率。利率越高，就越能激励人们把钱放在有利息的银行账户里，而不是把银行存款变成黄金。更高的利率起了作用。人们不再将他们的美元换成黄金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But raising interest rates also had an unintended (but entirely predictable) consequence: farmers and businesses now had to pay higher interest on their debts, which drove more of them out of business. This in turn made unemployment even worse and made prices fall even more.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但提高利率也产生了一个意想不到的（但完全可以预测的）后果：农民和企业现在不得不为他们的债务支付更高的利息，这使他们中更多的人退出了经营。这反过来又使失业更加严重，并使价格下跌更多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Raising interest rates was the exact opposite of what the Fed should have done. Today, the Fed raises interest rates when it is worried that the economy is overheating&mdash;when almost everyone has a job, and prices are rising faster and faster. It lowers rates when the economy is weak. By raising interest rates in the fall of 1931, the Fed put its boot on the throat of a country that was lying on the ground  after getting the snot kicked out of it for two years. The Chairman of the Fed said the rise in rates was called for “by every known rule,” which is to say the Fed did exactly what the gold standard demanded.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">加息与美联储应该做的事情完全相反。今天，美联储在担心经济过热时提高利率 —— 当几乎每个人都有工作，而且价格上涨越来越快时。它在经济疲软时降低利率。通过在 1931 年秋天提高利率，美联储把它的靴子放在一个国家的喉咙上，这个国家在被踢了两年的鼻涕后躺在了地上。美联储主席说，提高利率是“所有已知的规则”所要求的，也就是说，美联储完全按照金本位的要求做了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Decades later, the economists Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz pieced together an extraordinarily detailed history of money in America. They showed that the Fed’s policy of making money scarcer and raising interest rates&mdash;that is to say, following the rules of the gold standard&mdash;turned what would have been a nasty but ordinary downturn into a cataclysm. The Fed, and the gold standard it managed, caused the Great Depression.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几十年后，经济学家米尔顿·弗里德曼和安娜·施瓦茨将美国的货币历史拼凑得异常详细。他们表明，美联储使货币更加稀缺并提高利率的政策，也就是说，遵循金本位制的规则，将本来令人讨厌但普通的经济衰退变成了一场大灾难。美联储和它管理的金本位制造成了大萧条。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Today, the gold standard is a thing some people refer to with nostalgia. Politicians sometimes still talk about returning to it. But people who know what they’re talking about know this would be a disaster. In 2012, a survey asked dozens of US economists from across the political spectrum about the gold standard. Thirty-nine economists opposed returning to the gold standard. Not a single one supported it. Among today’s economists, the gold standard is not a controversial issue. Almost all of them think it’s a terrible idea.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">今天，金本位制是一些人带着怀旧情绪提到的东西。政客们有时仍在谈论恢复金本位制。但知道自己在说什么的人知道这将是一场灾难。2012 年，一项调查询问了来自不同政治光谱的几十位美国经济学家关于金本位制的问题。有 39 位经济学家反对恢复金本位制。没有一个人支持它。在今天的经济学家中，金本位制不是一个有争议的问题。几乎所有的人都认为这是个糟糕的主意。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But as the Depression unfolded, the link between the gold standard and the spreading catastrophe was still unclear. People thought they were suffering through the inevitable consequences of the boom of the 1920s and the crash of 1929. They thought it had nothing to do with a failure of money itself. In the presidential election of 1932&mdash;after three years of falling prices and rising unemployment, after all of the men in hats waiting in line for bread and women holding skinny children in shantytown cardboard houses&mdash;President Hoover was still all-in on the gold standard.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但随着大萧条的展开，金本位制和蔓延的灾难之间的联系仍然不清楚。人们认为他们正在经历二十世纪 20 年代的繁荣和 1929 年的崩溃所带来的不可避免的后果。他们认为这与货币本身的失败毫无关系。在 1932 年的总统选举中，在三年的物价下跌和失业率上升之后，在所有戴帽子的人排队等面包，妇女在棚户区纸板房里抱着瘦弱的孩子之后，胡佛总统仍然全心全意地坚持金本位制。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Being forced off the gold standard in the United States means chaos,” he said in a campaign speech. “All human experience has  demonstrated that that path once taken cannot be stopped, and that the moral integrity of the Government would be sacrificed because ultimately both currency and bonds must become valueless.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“在美国被迫脱离金本位意味着混乱”，他在一次竞选演讲中说。“所有的人类经验都表明，这条道路一旦走上就无法停止，政府的道德操守将被牺牲，因为最终货币和债券都必须变得毫无价值。”</section>

<p class="calibre9">His opponent, Franklin Roosevelt, promised “sound money”&mdash;a phrase traditionally associated with the gold standard. But Roosevelt never said exactly what he meant by that phrase. Roosevelt was elected in a landslide, in the middle of the greatest monetary crisis in American history, without ever telling anyone what he thought the country should do about money. As far as we can tell, he didn’t really know.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他的对手富兰克林·罗斯福承诺“健全的货币” —— 这个短语传统上与金本位制有关。但罗斯福从未说过他对这句话的确切含义。罗斯福在美国历史上最大的货币危机中以压倒性优势当选，但从未告诉任何人他认为国家应该对货币采取什么措施。据我们所知，他并不真正知道。</p>

<p class="calibre9">You know who knew? Irving damn Fisher. He’d been jumping up and down shouting the answer for twenty years. The essential problem was that the value of money was unstable, and as a result prices were falling. Falling prices were the root cause of the hoarding, and the defaults, and the bank failures. The solution was to get prices to start rising again. But to do that, Fisher knew, Americans needed to change the way they thought about money itself.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">你知道谁知道？欧文·该死的费希尔。二十年来，他一直上蹿下跳地喊着这个答案。基本问题是货币价值不稳定，因此价格在下降。价格下跌是囤积、违约和银行倒闭的根本原因。解决办法是让价格重新开始上涨。但要做到这一点，费雪知道，美国人需要改变他们对货币本身的看法。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-235" class="sect1">“The End of Western Civilization” 西方文明的终结</h1>

<p class="noindent">Fisher was no longer entirely alone in his views. The most famous economist in England, John Maynard Keynes, was influenced by Fisher. And in the United States, Fisher had on his side a few businessmen and a relatively unknown agricultural economist named George Warren. In the fall of 1932, this crew created the humbly named Committee for the Nation to Rebuild Prices and Purchasing Power, which was a successor to Fisher’s Stable Money Association. “The committee,” the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote, “lent a sort of pseudo-respectability to the inflation drive.”</p>

<p class="noindent">费舍尔的观点不再是完全孤立的。英国最有名的经济学家约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）也受到了费舍尔的影响。而在美国，费希尔身边有几个商人和一个相对不知名的农业经济学家乔治·沃伦。1932 年秋天，这些人创建了谦虚的国家重建价格和购买力委员会，它是费舍尔的稳定货币协会的继承者。历史学家阿瑟·施莱辛格（Arthur Schlesinger Jr.）写道：“该委员会为通货膨胀运动提供了某种虚假的尊重。”

<p class="calibre9"> Pseudo, indeed. Warren was a Cornell economist who studied agriculture and had spent years trying to figure out how to get hens to lay more eggs. When the price of produce and meat started falling in the ’20s, Warren became obsessed with the relationship between gold and commodity prices. He spent years gathering and analyzing centuries of data. Eventually, he was persuaded by Fisher’s basic argument that the only way out of the Depression was to raise prices, and the only way to raise prices was to break the hundred-year-old promise of the gold standard.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 伪装，确实如此。沃伦是康奈尔大学的经济学家，他研究农业，多年来一直试图找出如何让母鸡下更多的蛋。当农产品和肉类的价格在 20 年代开始下降时，沃伦开始痴迷于黄金和商品价格之间的关系。他花了几年时间收集和分析几个世纪的数据。最终，他被费舍尔的基本论点所说服，即摆脱大萧条的唯一途径是提高价格，而提高价格的唯一途径是打破金本位的百年承诺。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Warren happened to know Roosevelt personally. He had consulted with him about the trees on his estate in upstate New York and advised him on agriculture when Roosevelt was governor. After the election, Warren and Fisher both corresponded with Roosevelt and met with his top aides to push their views on money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">沃伦碰巧认识罗斯福本人。他曾就他在纽约州北部的庄园里的树木向他咨询，并在罗斯福担任州长时就农业问题向他提出建议。选举结束后，沃伦和费舍尔都与罗斯福通信，并与他的高级助手会面，宣传他们对金钱的看法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The day after Roosevelt was inaugurated, Warren got on a little private plane (the same model Lindbergh had flown across the Atlantic six years before) and flew to Washington to try to get in to see the president in person.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在罗斯福就职后的第二天，沃伦坐上一架小型私人飞机（与六年前林德伯格飞越大西洋的飞机型号相同），飞往华盛顿，试图亲自去见这位总统。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the weeks leading up to this moment, things had gone from bad to insane. Now, on top of all the human suffering of the Depression&mdash;the unemployment and hunger and homelessness&mdash;a wave of bank runs worse than any that had come before broke out across the country. As banks collapsed and states declared bank holidays, money itself began to disappear.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这一时刻到来之前的几周，事情已经从糟糕变成了疯狂。现在，在大萧条的所有人类痛苦之上，失业、饥饿和无家可归，全国各地爆发了一波比以往任何时候都要严重的银行挤兑。随着银行的倒闭和各州宣布银行假期，货币本身也开始消失。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People improvised. More than a hundred cities printed paper IOUs that circulated as temporary money. A Detroit department store bartered with farmers&mdash;a dress for three barrels of herring, three pairs of shoes for a five-hundred-pound sow. A boxing promoter at Madison Square Garden bartered tickets for “hats, shoes, cigars, combs, soap, chisels, kettles, sacks of potatoes, and foot balm.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们随机应变。超过一百个城市印制了纸质借据，作为临时货币流通。底特律的一家百货公司与农民进行交易，一件衣服换三桶鲱鱼，三双鞋换一头五百磅的母猪。麦迪逊广场花园的一位拳击推广人用门票换取“帽子、鞋子、雪茄、梳子、肥皂、凿子、水壶、一袋土豆和护脚膏”。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The most famous line Roosevelt delivered the day he was inaugurated was perhaps the perfect response to the biggest bank run in American history: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” In the middle of a gargantuan bank run&mdash;the canonical self-fulfilling prophecy&mdash;fear itself is the essential problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 罗斯福在就职当天发表的最著名的一句话，也许是对美国历史上最大的银行挤兑事件的完美回应。“我们唯一需要恐惧的是恐惧本身”。在巨大的银行挤兑中，典型的自我实现的预言 —— 恐惧本身就是根本问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Warren got in to see Roosevelt at the White House at 10:30 p.m. the next night. A few hours later, sitting in his study, smoking a cigarette in an ivory holder, in his second act as president, Roosevelt signed a proclamation that temporarily closed every bank in America. Warren was thrilled.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二天晚上 10 点半，沃伦在白宫见到了罗斯福。几个小时后，他坐在书房里，用象牙烟嘴抽着烟，在他作为总统的第二项行动中，罗斯福签署了一项公告，暂时关闭了美国的每一家银行。沃伦很激动。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Reporters suggested Roosevelt had just taken America off the gold standard. Will Woodin, Roosevelt’s Treasury Secretary, wasn’t having it. “It is ridiculous and misleading to say we have gone off the gold standard,” Woodin said. “We are definitely on the gold standard. Gold merely cannot be obtained for several days.” Woodin’s point for the reporters was that America was really, really on the gold standard, could not be more on the gold standard if it tried, and that America basically was even more on the gold standard than ever.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">记者们认为罗斯福刚刚让美国脱离了金本位制。罗斯福的财政部长威尔·伍丁不以为然。“说我们已经脱离了金本位制是荒谬和误导的”，伍丁说，“我们肯定是在金本位上。黄金只是在几天内无法获得。”伍丁对记者说，美国真的，真的在金本位上，如果它想的话，不可能更在金本位上，而且美国基本上比以前更在金本位。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In March 1933, Fisher and Warren were still outsiders. The nation’s top economists and bankers, along with Roosevelt’s own advisors, were still nearly unanimous in their belief that the United States needed to stay on the gold standard. Woodin wanted to make that clear. But Roosevelt wasn’t sure. Three days after he closed every bank in America and locked down the country’s gold supply, he held his first press conference, telling reporters off the record, “As long as nobody asks me whether we are off the gold standard or gold basis, that’s all right.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1933 年 3 月，费舍尔和沃伦仍然是局外人。国家的顶级经济学家和银行家，以及罗斯福自己的顾问，仍然几乎一致认为美国需要保持金本位。伍丁想把这一点说清楚。但罗斯福并不确定。在他关闭了美国的每一家银行并锁定了国家的黄金供应后三天，他召开了他的第一次新闻发布会，并在记录外告诉记者：“只要没有人问我我们是否脱离了金本位或黄金基础，那就可以了。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">That week, while the banks were still closed, Congress rushed through an emergency banking law. It spelled out how officials  would decide which banks could reopen. It also gave the government the right to force all Americans to sell their gold to the government.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那一周，当银行仍然关闭时，国会匆忙通过了一项紧急银行法。它规定了官员将如何决定哪些银行可以重新开业。它还赋予政府权利，迫使所有美国人向政府出售他们的黄金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The next weekend, Roosevelt gave his first national radio address. It was a moment of profound, even existential, peril for the country. People were seriously discussing the collapse of capitalism, and American farmers were in open revolt over falling prices. But Roosevelt didn’t talk about any of that. Instead, the new president went on the radio and said: “I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking.” And then&mdash;in the middle of everything&mdash;he gave the country a really basic primer on how banks and money work.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二个周末，罗斯福发表了他的第一次全国广播讲话。那是一个对国家有深刻影响的时刻，甚至是存在的危险。人们正在认真讨论资本主义的崩溃，美国农民因价格下跌而公开反抗。但罗斯福并没有谈论这些。相反，这位新总统在电台上说： “我想和美国人民谈几分钟关于银行业的问题。”然后，在一切的中间，他向全国人民介绍了关于银行和货币如何运作的真正的基本入门知识。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“First of all, let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank, the bank does not put the money into a safe-deposit vault… the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around… the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the total deposits in all of the banks…</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">"首先，请允许我陈述一个简单的事实：当你把钱存入银行时，银行并没有把钱存入保险库…… 银行把你的钱用于工作，使工业和农业的车轮转起来…… 全国所有货币的总量只是所有银行存款总量的一小部分…… </p>

<p class="calibre9">“What, then, happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March? Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold&mdash;a rush so great that the soundest banks could not get enough currency to meet the demand.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">"那么，在 2 月的最后几天和 3 月的头几天发生了什么？由于公众的信心受到损害，我们的大部分人普遍急于把银行存款变成货币或黄金，这种急切的心情使最健全的银行无法获得足够的货币来满足需求。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Federal officials, Roosevelt said, were now examining every bank in the country. Banks that were sound&mdash;the vast majority of the banks&mdash;would reopen. More than anything, Roosevelt wanted to break the cycle of fear that had led to one bank run after another. “After all,” he said, “there is an element in the readjustment of our  financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people.… Let us unite in banishing fear.… Together we cannot fail.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">罗斯福说，联邦官员现在正在检查全国的每一家银行。稳健的银行 —— 绝大多数的银行 —— 将重新开业。更重要的是，罗斯福希望打破导致一个又一个银行挤兑的恐惧循环。“毕竟”，他说，“在我们的金融体系的重新调整中，有一个因素比货币更重要，比黄金更重要，那就是人民的信心…… 让我们团结起来，消除恐惧…… 我们不能失败。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">Roosevelt understood that money is money because we believe it’s money. When people lost confidence in their banks, they ceased to think of their deposits as money, so they withdrew their deposits in the form of paper bills. When they lost confidence in paper, they turned it into gold. These changes weren’t neutral. With each step&mdash;from deposits to paper, from paper to gold&mdash;America was sliding backward into a world with less money that worked less well. It was this slide that Roosevelt was trying to reverse.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">罗斯福明白，钱之所以是钱，是因为我们相信它是钱。当人们对银行失去信心时，他们不再认为他们的存款是钱，所以他们以纸币的形式提取了他们的存款。当他们对纸币失去信心时，他们把它变成了黄金。这些变化并不是中性的。从存款到纸币，从纸币到黄金，每走一步，美国都在向后滑落，进入一个货币减少的世界，而且运作得更差。罗斯福试图扭转的正是这种滑坡。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The next day, banks started to reopen. Once again, people lined up outside their banks. But this time, they weren’t there to take money out. They were there to put money in. It was a bank run in reverse! The banking holiday and the fireside chat had worked. Once people trusted banks, people turned their paper back into bank deposits because they once again believed bank deposits were money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二天，银行开始重新营业。人们再次在银行外排队。但是这一次，他们不是去取钱的。他们是为了把钱放进去。这是一次反向的银行挤兑! 银行假期和炉边谈话起了作用。一旦人们信任银行，人们就会把他们的纸币重新变成银行存款，因为他们再次相信银行存款就是钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The bank holiday ended gradually, as one bank after another opened back up. But many people were still scared, prices were still depressed, and lending was still weak. A few weeks later, Roosevelt dropped another bomb. He issued executive order 6102:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行假期逐渐结束，一家又一家银行重新开门营业。但许多人仍然感到害怕，价格仍然低迷，贷款仍然疲软。几周后，罗斯福投下了另一颗炸弹。他发布了第 6102 号行政命令：</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">All persons are hereby required to deliver on or before May 1, 1933… to any member bank of the Federal Reserve System all gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates now owned by them… Whoever willfully violates any provision of this Executive Order or of these regulations or of any rule, regulation or license issued thereunder may be fined not more than $10,000, or… imprisoned for not more than ten years, or both…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">特此要求所有人在 1933 年 5 月 1 日或之前…… 向联邦储备系统的任何成员银行交付他们现在拥有的所有金币、金条和黄金证书…… 任何人故意违反本行政命令或这些条例的任何规定或根据这些条例发布的任何规则、条例或许可证，可处以不超过 10,000 美元的罚款，或…… 不超过 10 年的监禁，或两者并罚。</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9"> Roosevelt, like John Law before him, made it a crime for people simply to own gold. You could go to jail, the president said, just for keeping a few hundred dollars of gold coins in your desk drawer. (People could still own jewelry, and a token amount of coins.) Just imagine the response today if a president announced that all Americans had to turn in their gold. Yet in a sign of just how insane the spring of 1933 was, this wasn’t even the biggest moment of the month. That came a few weeks later.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 罗斯福，像他之前的约翰·劳一样，将人们仅仅拥有黄金的行为定为犯罪。总统说，只要在你的办公桌抽屉里放几百美元的金币，你就会被关进监狱。(人们仍然可以拥有珠宝和象征性的金币。)试想一下，如果今天有一位总统宣布所有美国人都必须交出他们的黄金，会有什么样的反应。然而，作为 1933 年春天多么疯狂的一个标志，这甚至不是这个月最大的时刻。那是几周后的事。</p>

<p class="calibre9">At the time, a farm bill was working its way through Congress. An Oklahoma senator was pushing a radical amendment that would give the president the power to change, for the first time in a hundred years, the value of the dollar in terms of gold. This was, of course, anathema. A dollar was defined as a fixed amount of gold. This was the essential, unchangeable truth of the gold standard, the bedrock on which the whole system was built.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当时，一项农业法案正在国会进行审议。一位俄克拉荷马州的参议员正在推动一项激进的修正案，该修正案将赋予总统百年来第一次改变美元在黄金方面的价值的权力。当然，这是不可取的。一美元被定义为固定数量的黄金。这是金本位制的基本的、不可改变的事实，是整个体系建立的基石。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But on April 18, Roosevelt gathered his closest economic advisors and, to their shock, he said he was going to back the amendment. With his support, it would almost certainly become law. “Congratulate me,” Roosevelt said. “We are off the gold standard.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在 4 月 18 日，罗斯福召集了他最亲密的经济顾问，令他们震惊的是，他说他将支持这项修正案。有了他的支持，它几乎肯定会成为法律。“祝贺我吧”，罗斯福说，“我们已经脱离了金本位制。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Then, as one advisor put it, “all hell broke loose in the room.” One banker-turned-advisor told Roosevelt that he was leading the country into “uncontrolled inflation and complete chaos.” Roosevelt’s own budget director agreed. The two men “fought like tigers&mdash;paced up and down and argued every which way,” trying to persuade Roosevelt to change his mind. The president laughed it off. He pulled a ten-dollar bill out of his pocket. “How do I know that’s any good?” he said. “The fact that I think it is, makes it good.” They argued until midnight. The president, unfazed, went to bed. “Well,” the budget director said, as the advisors walked out of the White House, “this is the end of Western civilization.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后，正如一位顾问所说，“房间里的一切都失控了。”一位从银行家变成顾问的人告诉罗斯福，他正带领国家进入“不受控制的通货膨胀和完全的混乱”。罗斯福自己的预算主管也同意。这两个人“像老虎一样打架，踱来踱去，争论不休”，试图劝说罗斯福改变主意。总统对此一笑置之。他从口袋里掏出一张 10 美元的钞票。“我怎么知道这有什么用？”他说。“我认为它是好的这一事实，使它成为好的。” 他们一直争论到半夜。总统不为所动，去睡觉了。当顾问们走出白宫时，预算主任说，“这是西方文明的终结。”

<p class="calibre9"> “I am now one of the happiest men in the world,” Fisher wrote to his wife the next day when he heard the news. “Happy that we are to get back prosperity, happy to have had a share in the work which turned the scales and in the laying of the foundations years ago. I feel that this week marks the culmination of my life work. Even if I had no more of life, I would feel that what I have had has been as worthwhile as any man has a right to expect.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我现在是世界上最幸福的人之一”，费舍尔在听到这个消息的第二天给他的妻子写道。“为我们将重新获得繁荣而高兴，为多年前曾参与扭转天平和奠定基础的工作而高兴。我觉得这个星期标志着我一生工作的高潮。即使我没有更多的生命，我也会觉得我所拥有的一切是值得的，因为任何人都有权利期待。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Roosevelt’s approach to money was ad hoc, ill informed, and contrary to what most smart, well-meaning, well-informed people thought he should do. Also, it worked. Not beautifully, not perfectly. But it definitely worked.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">罗斯福对金钱的做法是临时性的，不明智的，而且与大多数聪明的、善意的、知情的人认为他应该做的事情相悖。此外，它还起了作用。不是很好，不是很完美。但它确实起了作用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The spring of 1933 was the bottom of the Depression&mdash;the worst moment in the worst economic catastrophe in American history. After Roosevelt closed the banks, confiscated everyone’s gold, and abandoned the gold standard, everything started to turn around. Prices started rising. This finally eased the burden on debtors. Unemployment started falling. Incomes and the stock market started rising. The rise was slow, and uneven, and there were lots more problems, and the United States wouldn’t fully recover until World War II. Yet the trend was clear.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1933 年春天是大萧条的底部 —— 是美国历史上最严重的经济灾难中最糟糕的时刻。在罗斯福关闭银行，没收每个人的黄金，并放弃金本位制后，一切都开始转好。价格开始上涨。这终于减轻了债务人的负担。失业率开始下降。收入和股票市场开始上升。这种上升是缓慢的，也是不平衡的，还有很多问题，美国直到第二次世界大战才完全恢复。然而，这一趋势是明确的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Decades later, when economic historians looked back, not just at the United States, but also at Britain and France and Germany and Japan, they saw an unmistakable correlation. In country after country, the economy started to improve after the government gave up on the gold standard. And, economists have concluded, there was a cause-and-effect relationship. The gold standard locked countries in a terrible economic cycle. Breaking the link to gold broke the cycle.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几十年后，当经济史学家回顾过去时，不仅是美国，还有英国、法国、德国和日本，他们看到了一种明确无误的关联性。在一个又一个国家，在政府放弃了金本位制之后，经济开始改善。而且，经济学家得出结论，这是一种因果关系。金本位制将各国锁定在一个可怕的经济周期中。打破与黄金的联系就能打破这个循环。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The world did remain on a pseudo gold standard for decades; foreign governments could still trade dollars for gold (at a rate of $35 per ounce, as set by Roosevelt in 1934), but ordinary people  could no longer do so. Finally, in 1971, the United States broke the link to gold entirely. It became the job of the Federal Reserve to manage the value of the dollar&mdash;not in terms of gold, but in terms of the stuff ordinary Americans buy. In other words, America (and every other country) finally started thinking of money the way Irving Fisher wanted us to.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几十年来，世界确实保持着伪金本位制；外国政府仍然可以用美元换取黄金（按照罗斯福 1934 年制定的每盎司 35 美元的汇率），但普通人却不能再这样做了。最后，在 1971 年，美国完全打破了与黄金的联系。管理美元的价值成为美联储的工作，不是以黄金为单位，而是以普通美国人购买的东西为单位。换句话说，美国（以及其他所有国家）终于开始按照欧文·费舍尔希望我们做的那样思考货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But the essential moment was 1933. In the fall of that year, Roosevelt wrote to a Harvard economist, a close advisor who was insisting that Roosevelt immediately go back on the gold standard: “You place a former artificial gold standard among nations above human suffering and the crying needs of your own country.” The essential word in that sentence is not “suffering” or “crying.” It’s “artificial.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但关键时刻是 1933 年。那年秋天，罗斯福写信给哈佛大学的一位经济学家，这位亲密的顾问坚持要求罗斯福立即回到金本位制。“你把以前国家间的人工金本位放在人类痛苦和你自己国家的迫切需求之上。”这句话中的关键词不是“痛苦”或“哭泣”。而是“人为的”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The believers in the gold standard gave it the power of nature. They didn’t so much argue as simply took as given the fact that gold-as-money was the natural order of things, and that any other policy was not only unwise but also unnatural and therefore doomed to fail.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">金本位制的信徒们赋予了它自然的力量。他们并没有争论，而是简单地认为，黄金作为货币是事物的自然秩序，任何其他政策不仅不明智，而且不自然，因此注定要失败。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Roosevelt recognized that there was nothing natural about the gold standard; it was as artificial as any other monetary arrangement. The gold standard was a choice people had made&mdash;even if they didn’t recognize it as a choice. Roosevelt’s great genius was simply to say: we can choose something else.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">罗斯福认识到，金本位制并不自然；它和其他货币安排一样是人为的。金本位制是人们做出的选择，即使他们没有意识到这是一种选择。罗斯福的伟大天才只是说：“我们可以选择别的东西。”</p>

</h1>

<p class="noindent">Here is the standard story of the 2008 financial crisis:</p>

<p class="noindent">这里是 2008 年金融危机的标准故事：</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre5">Shady lenders gave ridiculous mortgages to unqualified buyers of overpriced houses.</li>

<li value="1" class="calibre5 cn">黑心贷款人向不合格的高价房买家提供荒谬的抵押贷款。

<li value="2" class="calibre5">The ridiculous mortgages were then bundled together, sliced up, and sold off to investors.</li>

<li value="2" class="calibre5 cn">这些荒谬的抵押贷款随后被捆绑在一起，切成片状，并出售给投资者。

<li value="3" class="calibre5">When housing prices started to fall, the unqualified buyers couldn’t pay back the ridiculous mortgages.</li>

<li value="3" class="calibre5 cn">当房价开始下跌时，不合格的买家无法偿还荒谬的抵押贷款。</li>

<li value="4" class="calibre5">The investors who bought the bundles of ridiculous mortgages blew up and took the economy down with them.</li>

<li value="4" class="calibre5 cn">购买了成捆的荒谬抵押贷款的投资者爆仓了，并把经济带入了困境。</li>

</ol>

<p class="calibre9">This story has the virtues of being true and dramatic. But it is incomplete. It is only part of the story of the crisis. The ridiculous mortgages alone would not have been enough to blow up the entire economy. There is a whole other part of the story that’s almost never told.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这个故事有真实和戏剧性的优点。但它是不完整的。它只是危机故事的一部分。仅仅是可笑的抵押贷款还不足以炸毁整个经济。这个故事还有另一部分，几乎从未被提及。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The other part is a story about money itself&mdash;a new kind of money that started flowing through a new kind of banking system that nobody quite knew was a banking system. This new kind of money drove the bananas rise of finance in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Also, this new kind of money helped a relatively small corner of the US mortgage market blow up the global economy. And there is a fundamental problem with this new kind of money that nobody has entirely fixed, and unless it gets fixed, it could blow up the world again.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">另一部分是关于货币本身的故事 —— 一种新的货币开始通过一种新的银行系统流动，没有人知道这是一个银行系统。这种新的货币推动了二十世纪末和二十一世纪初金融业的香蕉式崛起。同时，这种新的货币帮助美国抵押贷款市场的一个相对较小的角落炸毁了全球经济。这种新的货币有一个根本问题，没有人完全解决，除非它得到解决，否则它可能再次炸毁世界。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This chapter is that part of the story.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">本章是故事的这一部分。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-245" class="sect1">The Two Guys 两个小伙</h1>

<p class="noindent">“I always had an attraction to money,” Bruce Bent said. He started collecting empty soda bottles and turning them in for the deposit money when he was an eight-year-old kid in postwar Long Island. He tried being a paperboy, but the math just never made sense. “Delivering papers was a crap job: too much work, not enough pay.” So he got a job at the grocery store. “I was making $70 a week when I was 14. Outstanding money.”</p>

<p class="noindent">“钱对我总是有一种吸引力”，布鲁斯·本特说。当他还是战后长岛的一个八岁孩子时，他就开始收集空汽水瓶，并把它们上交以换取押金。他曾尝试过做报童，但数字总是说不通。“送报纸是一份糟糕的工作：工作太多，报酬不够。”所以他在杂货店找了一份工作。“我 14 岁的时候每周能挣 70 美元。这笔钱很可观。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">After high school he became a mailman, like his dad. He spent six months in the Marines as a reserve, went on to graduate from St. John’s University, and, like lots of people who are attracted to money, found his way to a job in finance. “I went down to Wall Street and was the flunky to the managing partners.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">高中毕业后，他成为一名邮递员，就像他父亲一样。他在海军陆战队当了六个月的预备役，从圣约翰大学毕业后，像许多被金钱吸引的人一样，找到了一份金融工作。“我去了华尔街，成为管理合伙人的小弟。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few years later, he got a job in the investment department at an insurance company. He started on the same day as the man who would be his boss, Harry Brown. Brown was a Harvard graduate  and the grandson of a federal judge and just a very different kind of guy than Bent.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几年后，他在一家保险公司的投资部门找到一份工作。他和即将成为他老板的哈里·布朗在同一天开始工作。布朗是哈佛大学的毕业生，也是一位联邦法官的孙子，是一个与本特非常不同的人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">They met for the first time on their first day, in the office of Harry’s boss (Bent’s boss’s boss). A few minutes later&mdash;which is to say, a few minutes after they’d met&mdash;Harry looked at Bruce and said to the big boss: “I don’t like him. I don’t want him working in my department.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他们第一天见面，在哈里的老板（本特的老板的老板）的办公室里。几分钟后 —— 也就是说，在他们见面几分钟后 —— 哈利看着布鲁斯，对大老板说。“我不喜欢他。我不想让他在我的部门工作。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Why not?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“为啥？” </p>

<p class="calibre9">“He’s a New York City wiseass and I don’t want him in my department.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“他是一个纽约市的小聪明，我不希望他在我的部门。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">“Deal with him.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“搞定他。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the end, Bent and Brown loved working with each other. A few years later, they left their jobs to start their own company: Brown and Bent. They thought they would match insurance companies that had money to invest with companies that needed to borrow. But business was slow.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最后，本特和布朗喜欢上了彼此一起工作。几年后，他们离开工作岗位，创办了自己的公司。布朗和本特。他们认为，他们将为那些有钱投资的保险公司和需要借款的公司牵线搭桥。但生意很不景气。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bent had a wife and two kids and two mortgages. He bought a thrift-store bike to save on bus fare. He rode his bike to the train and rode the train to work and sat across from Brown in the office, where they kicked ideas back and forth. “We were trying to find something that was a money-earning experience,” Bent said.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">本特有一个妻子、两个孩子和两笔抵押贷款。他买了一辆旧货店的自行车以节省公交车费。他把自行车骑到火车上，然后骑着火车去上班，在办公室里坐在布朗的对面，他们在那里来回讨论想法。本特说：“我们试图找到一些可以赚钱的经验。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">After a few years of this marginal existence, Bent and Brown saw an opportunity. Federal regulations put in place in 1933 capped interest rates on bank savings accounts and prohibited banks from paying any interest at all on checking accounts. But people who had lots of money and were willing to tie it up for a few weeks or months could get more interest from opening savings accounts of at least $100,000 or buying short-term government debt known as Treasury bills (or T-bills).</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这种边缘化生存的几年后，本特和布朗看到了一个机会。1933 年出台的联邦法规规定了银行储蓄账户的利率上限，并禁止银行对支票账户支付任何利息。但是，拥有大量资金并愿意将其捆绑几周或几个月的人可以通过开设至少 10 万美元的储蓄账户或购买被称为国库券（或 T-bills）的短期政府债务获得更多利息。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Bent and Brown decided to figure out how investors who didn’t want to tie up their money, or who couldn’t make such a big investment, could get the higher interest rates offered by T-bills and jumbo savings accounts. One afternoon, Bent had an idea. “I looked up at Brown and said, ‘Why not a mutual fund?’” Bent said. “He said he didn’t know anything about mutual funds. I said, ‘I don’t know anything about mutual funds either, but I think it would work.’”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 本特和布朗决定搞清楚，那些不想把钱绑在一起的投资者，或者无法进行如此大额投资的投资者，如何才能获得国库券和巨额储蓄账户所提供的较高利率。一天下午，本特有了一个想法。“我抬头看着布朗，说：‘为什么不做共同基金’？”本特说，“他说他对共同基金一无所知。我说，我也不知道什么是共同基金，但我认为它可以。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Mutual funds are pools of money that typically are invested in stocks or bonds. If you have a retirement account, there’s a very good chance that you are an investor in one or more mutual funds. When investors buy shares in a mutual fund, they are actually buying an ownership stake in all the stocks or bonds (or both) that the fund owns. The value of the mutual fund shares rises and falls every day with the value of the stocks and bonds in the fund.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">共同基金是一个资金池，通常投资于股票或债券。如果你有一个退休账户，很有可能你是一个或多个共同基金的投资者。当投资者购买共同基金的股票时，他们实际上是在购买该基金拥有的所有股票或债券（或两者）的所有权。共同基金份额的价值每天都随着基金中的股票和债券的价值而上升和下降。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Brown and Bent wanted to create a mutual fund that would feel like money in the bank&mdash;not like an investment in stocks or bonds. They wanted it to have all the convenience of a checking account, but with a higher interest rate for savers. So they made a few tweaks to the mutual fund model.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">布朗和本特想创建一个共同基金，让人感觉像是在银行里的钱，而不像投资股票或债券。他们希望它具有支票账户的所有便利性，但为储蓄者提供更高的利息。因此，他们对共同基金的模式做了一些调整。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Investors would buy shares in their fund. The fund would then take investors’ money and lend it out&mdash;to the government, in the form of Treasury bills, and to banks, in the form of big savings accounts. These were short-term, ultra-safe investments. So safe, in fact, that the price of the mutual fund shares didn’t need to fluctuate every day like funds that owned stocks or riskier bonds. Brown and Bent decided to set the share price at $1 per share. And they were able to use an accounting system such that, outside of some catastrophe, they would be able to leave the price at $1 per share. Just like money in the bank.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">投资者将购买其基金的股票。然后，该基金将拿着投资者的钱，以国库券的形式借给政府，并以大额储蓄账户的形式借给银行。这些都是短期的、超安全的投资。事实上，如此安全，以至于共同基金份额的价格不需要像拥有股票或风险较大的债券的基金那样每天波动。布朗和本特决定将股票价格定为每股 1 美元。他们能够使用一个会计系统，以便在一些灾难之外，他们能够将价格保持在每股 1 美元。就像银行里的钱一样。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> They wanted to call their fund the “Savings Fund,” but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which regulates mutual funds, wouldn’t let them. So they called it the “Reserve Fund,” similarly boring, which is what they were going for.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他们想把他们的基金称为“储蓄基金”，但负责监管共同基金的证券交易委员会（SEC）不允许他们这么做。因此，他们把它称为“储备基金”，同样的无聊，这也是他们的目的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Fund opened for business in 1972. By the end of 1973, they were managing $100 million. Within a few years, a bunch of competing funds had sprung up. This new kind of fund came to be called a money-market fund. Pretty soon, you could write checks against your money-market fund&mdash;which is to say, you could use your money-market money to buy stuff. Just like money in the bank!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">该基金于 1972 年开始营业。到 1973 年底，他们管理着 1 亿美元的资金。几年内，一堆竞争性基金纷纷涌现。这种新类型的基金被称为货币市场基金。很快，你可以用你的货币市场基金开出支票，也就是说，你可以用你的货币市场基金买东西。就像银行里的钱一样！</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-249" class="sect1">The Big Banks Get In on It 大银行参与其中</h1>

<p class="noindent">Corporations with extra cash on hand started parking hundreds of millions of dollars in money-market funds. By 1982, ten years after Bent and Brown came up with the idea in their tiny office, money funds had more than $200 billion, with billions more flowing in every year.</p>

<p class="noindent">手头有多余现金的公司开始将数以亿计的美元存入货币市场基金。到 1982 年，也就是本特和布朗在他们的小办公室里提出这个想法的十年后，货币基金已经超过了 2000 亿美元，每年还有数十亿美元流入。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The funds suddenly had more cash than they knew what to do with. Bent and Brown stuck with investing in large bank deposits and government debt, but other fund managers started looking for new options. Some funds started buying something called “commercial paper,” which was basically a way to make short-term loans to safe, stable companies. In the 1980s, money-market funds became the biggest buyers of commercial paper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这些基金突然有了更多的现金，他们不知道该如何处理。本特和布朗坚持投资于大型银行存款和政府债务，但其他基金经理开始寻找新的选择。一些基金开始购买名为“商业票据”的东西，这基本上是向安全、稳定的公司提供短期贷款的一种方式。在二十世纪 80 年代，货币市场基金成为商业票据的最大买家。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Vast flows of money were now shifting from banks to money funds. So Citibank, one of the biggest banks in the country, figured out how to do the thing banks do: get in the middle of a vast flow of  money. With a bunch of complicated legal and financial maneuvering, Citi invented something called “asset-backed commercial paper.” It was a new way for money-market funds to lend money to companies that weren’t safe enough to issue commercial paper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大量的资金流现在正从银行转向货币基金。因此，花旗银行，该国最大的银行之一，想出了如何做银行所做的事情：进入巨大的资金流中。通过一系列复杂的法律和金融操作，花旗银行发明了一种叫做“资产支持商业票据”的东西。这是货币市场基金向那些不够安全、无法发行商业票据的公司借钱的一种新方式。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Soon other banks jumped in. By the early ’90s, billions of dollars were flowing into asset-backed commercial paper, and banks were selling more every month.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">很快，其他银行也加入进来。到 90 年代初，数十亿美元流入资产支持商业票据，而且银行每个月都在出售更多的票据。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bent, who’d started it all, thought commercial paper was too risky for money-market funds. “Commercial paper is anathema to the concept of the money fund,” he told a reporter in 2001. “People prostituted the concept by putting garbage in the funds and reaching for yield.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">开始这一切的本特认为，商业票据对货币市场基金来说风险太大。2001 年，他对记者说：“商业票据与货币基金的概念格格不入”。他在 2001 年对记者说：“人们通过把垃圾放进基金和追求收益率的方式使这一概念像是在卖淫一样。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bent’s Reserve Fund still invested only in government-backed debt and certificates of deposit from old-fashioned banks. “We consider it prudent rather than plain,” Bent’s son, who was president of the family business by this point, told the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">本特的储备基金仍然只投资于政府支持的债务和老式银行的存款证明。“我们认为这是谨慎的，而不是朴素的”，本特的儿子，此时已是家族企业的总裁，告诉《华尔街日报》.</p>

<p class="calibre9">In a few years, the Bents would quietly abandon this worldview at exactly the wrong time.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几年后，本特人将在一个完全错误的时间点上悄悄放弃这种世界观。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-251" class="sect1">The Money Boom 货币的繁荣</h1>

<p class="noindent">The last decades of the twentieth century were an extraordinary financial boom, and lots of rich people and corporations and pension funds and foreign governments found themselves with the pleasant problem of having more cash than they knew what to do with.</p>

<p class="noindent">二十世纪的最后几十年是一个非同寻常的金融繁荣期，许多富人、公司、养老基金和外国政府发现自己有一个令人愉快的问题，那就是他们的现金多得不知该如何处理。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This wasn’t money they wanted to invest. This was money that they essentially wanted to put in their checking account. Money they would need to make payroll next week, or cover the retirement checks sent out next month, or whatever. Since government  insurance on checking accounts topped out at $100,000, there wasn’t an obvious place to put this cash. The classic thing to do in this setting is to buy very short-term Treasury debt, but there was so much cash to park that there just weren’t enough Treasuries to go around.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这不是他们想投资的钱。这笔钱他们基本上是想放在他们的支票账户上。他们需要这些钱来支付下周的工资，或支付下个月发出的退休支票，或其他什么。由于政府对支票账户的保险上限为 10 万美元，所以没有一个明显的地方可以放这些现金。在这种情况下，典型的做法是购买非常短期的国债，但有如此多的现金需要停放，以至于没有足够的国债可以使用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A lot of these people invested in money-market funds; some imitated the funds and invested on their own. The money-market funds, with more money than they knew what to do with, turned around and started lending huge amounts of money to investment banks on Wall Street. (Investment banks, despite their name, aren’t like regular banks; they’re not really in the business of taking deposits and making loans, and they don’t have the government guarantees that regular banks have.) All this money innocently looking for a safe, short-term home was the air that inflated the great finance bubble of the early twenty-first century.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这些人中有很多人投资于货币市场基金；有些人模仿这些基金，自己投资。货币市场基金有了更多的钱，他们不知道该怎么办，于是转过身来，开始向华尔街的投资银行借出大量的钱。(投资银行，尽管他们的名字，并不像普通的银行；他们并不真正从事吸收存款和贷款的业务，而且他们没有普通银行所拥有的政府担保）。) 所有这些无辜地寻找安全、短期住所的资金，是吹起二十一世纪初巨大金融泡沫的空气。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The aughts come. The housing boom is booming. Wildly unqualified borrowers are taking out absurdly large mortgages on overpriced houses. But in this version of the story we are starting a step earlier. We are looking at where the money that is being loaned to the unqualified buyers of the overpriced houses is coming from. The answer, as you have already guessed: money-market mutual funds! Pension funds and corporations that needed to park their cash! This new kind of money flowing in vast sums through money-market mutual funds and asset-backed commercial paper and investment banks was the money that inflated the bubble.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 高峰时期来了。房产热潮正在蓬勃发展。极度不合格的借款人在价格过高的房屋上获得了荒谬的大额抵押贷款。但在这个版本的故事中，我们要早一步开始。我们正在研究向不合格的高价房买家贷款的资金从何而来。答案，正如你已经猜到的：货币市场共同基金、养老基金和需要停放现金的公司! 这种通过货币市场共同基金和资产抵押商业票据以及投资银行大量流动的新资金是吹大泡沫的资金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In late 2006, home prices stopped rising and corporate treasurers and money-market funds started getting nervous. So they started asking for their money back from some of the investment funds that had borrowed money (via asset-backed commercial paper) to invest in mortgages. In a few cases, the investors couldn’t come  up with the money. When that happened, lots more people started asking for their money back.</p>

<p class="calibre9">2006 年底，房价停止上涨，企业财务人员和货币市场基金开始紧张。于是他们开始向一些借钱（通过资产支持商业票据）投资抵押贷款的投资基金要回他们的钱。在一些情况下，投资者无法拿出钱来。当这种情况发生时，更多的人开始要求拿回他们的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">To the outside world, this looked like some super-wonky thing going on in some arcane corner of the financial world. But to Paul McCulley, it looked like something else&mdash;something much more worrying.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在外界看来，这就像是在金融世界的某个神秘角落里发生的一些超级古怪的事情。但对保罗·麦考利来说，它看起来像别的东西 —— 更令人担忧的东西。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-254" class="sect1">Shadow Banking 影子银行</h1>

<p class="noindent">McCulley was an economist who worked at a giant investment firm called PIMCO. He looked out across this world of money-market funds and asset-backed commercial paper and said: this is not just a bunch of arcane investment vehicles. It’s an entire banking system that nobody quite recognizes as a banking system.</p>

<p class="noindent">麦考利是一位经济学家，在一家名为 PIMCO 的巨型投资公司工作。他看着这个由货币市场基金和资产支持的商业票据组成的世界，说：“这不仅仅是一堆神秘的投资工具。这是一个完整的银行系统，没有人认识到它是一个银行系统。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">A bank borrows money from depositors, who can ask for their money back at any time. Then the bank turns around and makes long-term loans. The fundamental bank thing that the bank is doing is borrowing short-term and lending long-term. The money-market funds and asset-backed commercial paper markets were doing the same thing: taking money that investors could demand at a moment’s notice and turning around and lending it out. In the shadows of the regulated banking system, a whole new system of quasi-banks had sprung up. And now there was a problem.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行向储户借钱，储户可以在任何时候要求归还他们的钱。然后银行转过身来，进行长期贷款。银行所做的基本事情是短期借款和长期贷款。货币市场基金和资产支持的商业票据市场也在做同样的事情：拿着投资者可以随时要求的钱，转身就把它借出去。在受监管的银行系统的阴影下，一个全新的准银行系统已经兴起。现在出现了一个问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“What’s going on is really simple,” McCulley told a room full of central bankers at a meeting in the summer of 2007. “We’re having a run on the shadow banking system.” It was the first time anyone had used that term to describe this new universe: shadow banking.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“正在发生的事情其实很简单”，麦考利在 2007 年夏天的一次会议上对一屋子的中央银行家说。“我们正在对影子银行系统进行挤兑。”那是第一次有人用这个词来描述这个新的世界：影子银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Everybody thought we had solved bank runs in the Depression.  The government started guaranteeing the money people deposited in the bank so people didn’t need to rush to the bank at the first sign of trouble anymore. The Fed stood ready to lend to sound banks that were in a temporary crunch. The government stood behind everybody’s bank account. Our money was safe.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">每个人都认为我们已经解决了大萧条时期的银行挤兑问题。 政府开始为人们存入银行的钱提供担保，因此人们不再需要一有麻烦就冲向银行。美联储随时准备向处于暂时紧缩状态的健全银行提供贷款。政府站在每个人的银行账户后面。我们的钱很安全。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But without anybody really realizing it, a parallel banking structure had sprung up. It was massive, and it was global. It allowed hedge funds and investment banks to borrow more and more and more money, to make bigger and bigger bets. It provided a lot of the money to people buying homes in the United States. It had all of the risk of traditional banking&mdash;the potential for a run that could wreck the entire economy&mdash;with none of the safety net.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但没有人真正意识到，一个平行的银行结构已经出现。它是大规模的，而且是全球性的。它使对冲基金和投资银行能够借到越来越多的钱，进行越来越大的赌注。它为在美国买房的人提供了大量的资金。它具有传统银行业务的所有风险 —— 有可能发生可能破坏整个经济的挤兑 —— 但没有安全网。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“The short-term IOUs that are issued by shadow banks… are called cash equivalents,” Morgan Ricks, a trader turned law professor, wrote later. “Corporate treasurers and other businesspeople just call them cash.” In other words, shadow banks were creating real money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“影子银行发行的短期借据…… 被称为现金等价物”，从交易员变成法律教授的摩根·里克斯后来写道。“公司财务人员和其他商人只是称它们为现金。”换句话说，影子银行正在创造真正的货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By 2007, shadow banking was bigger than traditional banking. And the depositors in the shadow banks&mdash;the corporate treasurers and money-market funds and pension funds that had trillions of dollars of cash&mdash;were starting to demand their money back. It was the start of the biggest bank run in history.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到 2007 年，影子银行已经比传统银行大了。而影子银行的储户 —— 那些拥有数万亿美元现金的企业财务人员和货币市场基金以及养老基金 —— 开始要求归还他们的钱。这是历史上最大的银行挤兑事件的开始。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The run hit Bear Stearns first. Bear was a small, risk-loving investment bank that borrowed tons of money from money-market funds and used it to buy mortgage-backed bonds. In March 2008, the funds decided the risk of lending to Bear was no longer worth it. Fidelity, the biggest money-market fund manager in America, had been lending Bear nearly $10 billion. In a single week, they demanded every penny of it back.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这次挤兑首先打击了贝尔斯登公司。贝尔斯登是一家小型的、热爱风险的投资银行，它从货币市场基金那里借了大量的钱，用来购买抵押贷款支持的债券。2008 年 3 月，这些基金认为借给贝尔斯登的风险已经不值得了。美国最大的货币市场基金经理富达公司（Fidelity）已经借给贝尔斯登将近 100 亿美元。在一个星期内，他们要求归还每一分钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the moment in the bank run when all the depositors line  up outside the bank to withdraw their money. It’s the moment when the British navy official says these notes are not money. But instead of 5,000 people with deposits of a few thousand dollars each, it was 50 institutions with deposits of hundreds of millions each. Bear had taken the borrowed money and used it to buy billions of dollars in mortgage-backed bonds. Now nobody wanted to buy those bonds. Bear Stearns’ depositors&mdash;including the money-market funds&mdash;wanted their money back, and Bear Stearns didn’t have it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这就是银行挤兑中所有储户在银行外排队取钱的时刻。这是当英国海军官员说这些纸币不是钱的时刻。但是，不是 5000 人每人有几千美元的存款，而是 50 家机构每人有数亿美元的存款。熊市拿着借来的钱，用来购买数十亿美元的抵押贷款支持的债券。现在没有人愿意购买这些债券。贝尔斯登的储户 —— 包括货币市场基金 —— 想要回他们的钱，而贝尔斯登却没有足够的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bear Stearns wasn’t a commercial bank. It didn’t hold deposits for regular people and wasn’t supposed to be able to borrow from the Fed. But the Fed invoked a legal provision that said it could lend to anyone in “unusual and exigent circumstances,” and loaned $13 billion to Bear. The Fed was following Walter Bagehot’s nineteenth-century advice to “lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to ‘this man and that man.’” The central bank was pouring money into the shadow bank run, acting as lender of last resort.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">贝尔斯登不是一家商业银行。它没有为普通人持有存款，也不应该能够从美联储那里借款。但美联储援引了一项法律规定，即它可以在“不寻常和紧急的情况下”贷款给任何人，并向贝尔斯登贷款 130 亿美元。美联储遵循沃尔特·巴吉特（Walter Bagehot）十九世纪的建议，“向商人、小银行家、‘这个人和那个人’贷款”。中央银行正在向影子银行的运行注入资金，充当最后的贷款人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The loan allowed Bear to open for business on Friday. That weekend, in a shotgun wedding, JPMorgan Chase bought Bear Stearns outright. As part of the deal, the Fed agreed to buy $30 billion in mortgage bonds from Bear Stearns. And then Bear Stearns ceased to exist. The bonds, in the end, were fine. The Fed eventually got its money back, with interest.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这笔贷款让贝尔斯登在周五开始营业。那个周末，在一场猎枪婚礼中，摩根大通直接买下了贝尔斯登。作为交易的一部分，美联储同意从贝尔斯登购买 300 亿美元的抵押贷款债券。然后贝尔斯登就不存在了。这些债券，最终还是好的。美联储最终连本带利地拿回了自己的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few months later, the bank run came for another investment bank: Lehman Brothers. Lehman was Bear Stearns but bigger. The company owned an enormous quantity of crappy mortgage-backed securities. It had borrowed so, so much money. In September 2008, approximately everybody who had been parking their money with Lehman decided they wanted it back. Lehman didn’t have the money. It had a bunch of mortgage-backed bonds that nobody  wanted to buy. Early in the morning on Monday, September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几个月后，另一家投资银行发生了银行挤兑。雷曼兄弟。雷曼跟贝尔斯登一模一样，但规模更大。该公司拥有大量蹩脚的抵押贷款支持的证券。它借了很多很多的钱。2008 年 9 月，大约所有在雷曼停放资金的人都决定要回他们的资金。雷曼没有钱。它有一堆抵押贷款支持的债券，没有人愿意买。9 月 15 日星期一清晨，雷曼宣布破产。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-258" class="sect1">Bruce Bent Breaks the Buck 布鲁斯·本特破釜沉舟</h1>

<p class="noindent">Three days before Lehman filed for bankruptcy, the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> ran a small story, deep inside the paper, about an obscure regulatory question in the money-market fund industry. The story quoted Bruce Bent, inventor of the money-market fund, arguing once again that other money fund managers were taking too many risks. “Lest we forget, the purpose of the money fund is to bore the investor into a sound night’s sleep,” he said.</p>

<p class="noindent">在雷曼申请破产的前三天，《华尔街日报》刊登了一篇小故事，在报纸的深处，关于货币市场基金行业的一个不起眼的监管问题。这篇报道引用了货币市场基金的发明者布鲁斯·本特的话，再次论证了其他货币基金经理承担了太多的风险。他说：“我们不要忘记，货币基金的目的是让投资者在晚上睡个安稳觉。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">Bent loved this theme, and he was hitting it hard. In the Reserve Funds’ annual report a few months earlier, he had written:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">本特很喜欢这个主题，而且他的打击力度很大。在几个月前的储备基金年度报告中，他曾写道：</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">One year has passed since the… [subprime] crisis shook the foundation of our markets, which has investors questioning the safety of their money funds. Good! We are pleased to report that you, and the markets in general, have embraced the very concept and foundation on which The Reserve was founded, an unwavering discipline focused on protecting your principal…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">自从…… （次贷）危机动摇了我们的市场基础，这让投资者质疑他们的货币基金的安全性，已经过去一年了。很好! 我们很高兴地报告，你和整个市场已经接受了储备金成立的概念和基础，一个坚定不移的纪律，专注于保护你的本金……</p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9">But readers who looked past Bent’s letter and into the details of the report would have noticed something surprising. The Reserve Primary Fund was no longer the “prudent rather than plain” fund that limited itself to investing in boring bank deposits and government-backed bonds. Now the firm was taking investors’ money and buying tens of billions of dollars of commercial  paper&mdash;just the sort of riskier investment Bent had once said money-market funds should avoid.</p>


<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，如果读者看透了本特的信，进入报告的细节，就会注意到一些令人惊讶的事情。储备初级基金不再是那个“谨慎而非平淡”的基金，它只限于投资无聊的银行存款和政府支持的债券。现在，该公司正拿着投资者的钱，购买数百亿美元的商业票据 —— 正是本特曾经说过的货币市场基金应该避免的那种风险较大的投资。</p>

<p class="calibre9">On the morning of September 15, 2008, the Bents’ Reserve Fund (now technically called the Reserve Primary Fund) owned $785 million in commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers. Which is to say that Lehman Brothers, which had just declared bankruptcy, owed the Reserve Fund $785 million. It represented a little more than 1 percent of the total amount of money in the fund. That is just a tiny sliver! Even if the Primary Fund could recover no money at all from Lehman&mdash;and they could almost certainly recover something&mdash;the other 99 percent of the fund would be fine. If the Reserve Fund were a normal mutual fund, this would have been a nonevent. Mutual funds lose or gain 1 percent all the time.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">2008 年 9 月 15 日上午，本特的储备基金（现在技术上称为储备初级基金）拥有 7.85 亿美元由雷曼兄弟发行的商业票据。这就是说，刚刚宣布破产的雷曼兄弟公司欠储备基金 7.85 亿美元。它占该基金总金额的 1% 多一点。这只是一个很小的一部分! 即使初级基金根本无法从雷曼那里收回任何资金 —— 而他们几乎肯定可以收回一些 —— 基金的其他 99% 也不会有事。如果储备基金是一个正常的共同基金，这干脆算不上事儿。共同基金一直在损失或增加 1%。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But the Reserve Fund was not a normal mutual fund. It was a money-market fund. Despite the standard warnings that the fund might lose money, people did not think of their money in the fund as an investment. They thought of their money in the fund as their money. You put in a dollar, you get back a dollar whenever you want it. If the fund were to lose 1 percent of its value, investors wouldn’t get all their money back. This, for a money-market fund, is a disaster known as “breaking the buck.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但储备基金不是一个普通的共同基金。它是一种货币市场基金。尽管有标准的警告说该基金可能会亏损，但人们并没有把他们在基金中的钱看作是一种投资。他们认为他们在基金中的钱是他们的钱。你投入一美元，只要你想要，就能拿回一美元。如果基金损失 1% 的价值，投资者不会拿回他们所有的钱。对于货币市场基金来说，这是一场被称为“破财”的灾难。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The savvy institutional investors who knew what was going on rushed to pull their money out of the Reserve Fund. By midmorning, just hours after Lehman declared bankruptcy, investors had redeemed $10 billion&mdash;ten times as much as in a typical morning. Like a bank, the Fund didn’t have that cash on hand. It had a bunch of bonds and commercial paper it had to sell to get the money. So, at 10:10 a.m., the bank that managed redemptions for the Reserve Fund stopped giving investors their money back.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">精明的机构投资者知道发生了什么，急忙把他们的钱从储备基金中撤出。到了中午，也就是雷曼宣布破产后的几个小时，投资者已经赎回了 100 亿美元 —— 是往常早上的十倍。像银行一样，该基金手头没有这些现金。它有一堆债券和商业票据，它必须卖掉才能得到这些钱。因此，在上午 10 点 10 分，为储备基金管理赎回的银行停止向投资者归还资金。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Over the next few hours, depositors tried to withdraw another $8 billion. But the Reserve Fund couldn’t sell assets fast enough to come up with the money. The shadow bank run was hidden from the public, but it’s audible in the internal phone calls fund executives were having that day. (The calls were later made public in court records.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在接下来的几个小时里，储户试图再提取 80 亿美元。但储备基金无法快速出售资产来筹集资金。影子银行的运行对公众来说是隐蔽的，但在基金高管们当天的内部电话中是可以听到的。(这些电话后来在法庭记录中被公开了。) </p>

<p class="calibre9">“We’re in the hole for about eight,” one executive says. (Terrifyingly, he’s speaking in billions of dollars.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我们大约有 8 个洞”，一位主管说。(可怕的是，他是以数十亿美元为单位说的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And then a minute later:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然后一分钟后：</p>

<p class="calibre9">“How much have we raised?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我们已经筹集了多少钱？”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“We’ve raised about a billion. That’s all we’ve been able to raise…”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我们已经筹集了大约 10 亿。这就是我们所能筹集到的全部资金……”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Oh, my gosh.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“哦，我的天哪。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">“Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“嗯。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">“Well, that’s really bad.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“嗯，这真的很糟糕。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the morning Lehman went bankrupt. The biggest financial crisis in seventy years. Everybody is demanding their money back everywhere. All of the shadow banks are suddenly trying to sell all of their assets. But nobody’s buying!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这是雷曼破产的早晨。这是七十年来最大的金融危机。每个人都在到处要求拿回他们的钱。所有的影子银行都突然试图出售他们所有的资产。但是没有人买！</p>

<p class="calibre9">As these two guys are talking on the phone, they actually see the run happening in front of them. Giant companies that have parked their cash with the Reserve Fund are calling and asking for their money back. One of those companies was ADP, which does HR-type stuff for other companies.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当这两个人在电话中交谈时，他们实际上看到了将要发生在他们身上的事情。那些将现金停放在储备基金的巨型公司正在打电话，要求拿回他们的钱。其中一家公司是 ADP，它为其他公司做人力资源类的工作。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Oh, fuck.… frickin’ ADP just took out fucking 213,” one of guys on the call says. He means $213 million.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我肏！ADP 刚刚拿出了他妈的 213”，电话中的一个家伙说。他的意思是 2.13 亿美元。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“It’s not going to&mdash;nothing’s going to go,” the other guy says.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“它不会 —— 一毛钱都提不走”，另一个人说。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the part of the bank run where the teller puts down the glass in the window and walks away while depositors frantically scream for their money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这就是银行挤兑的部分，出纳员放下窗口的玻璃走了，而储户则疯狂地喊着要钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> “Those customers are not going to get their money tonight.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“那些客户今晚拿不走他们的钱。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“That’s going to be the kiss of death.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“这将是死亡之吻。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">All that day and into Tuesday morning, the Bents tried to borrow money. They tried to sell a chunk of their firm. But it didn’t happen. They couldn’t come up with the money. Tuesday afternoon, the fund announced: “The value of the debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.… and held by the Primary Fund has been valued at zero effective 4:00PM New York time today. As a result, the NAV [net asset value] of the Primary Fund, effective as of 4:00PM, is $0.97 per share.” The Reserve Primary Fund had broken the buck.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">从那天起一直到星期二早上，本特夫妇都在试图借钱。他们试图卖掉他们公司的一大块股权。但这并没有发生。他们没能拿出钱来。周二下午，该基金宣布。“由雷曼兄弟控股有限公司（……）发行的、由初级基金持有的债务证券的价值已被估价为零，从纽约时间今天下午 4 点开始生效。因此，初级基金的资产净值[净资产价值]，从 4:00PM 开始生效，为每股 0.97 美元。”储备初级基金已经破发。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As the news spread, investors started pulling hundreds of billions of dollars from other money-market funds. To meet the redemptions, the funds had to sell their assets&mdash;including their commercial paper. But nobody wanted to buy commercial paper. Nobody wanted to lend, even to sound borrowers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">随着消息的传播，投资者开始从其他货币市场基金中提取数千亿美元的资金。为了满足赎回需求，这些基金不得不出售其资产 —— 包括其商业票据。但没有人愿意购买商业票据。没有人愿意贷款，即使是对健全的借款人。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Suddenly GE and Caterpillar and Boeing were having trouble borrowing money to make payroll and pay suppliers.… Everybody is running from all forms of commercial paper,” a lawyer who worked at the New York Fed told me. “One of our senior economists said, ‘Well, that’s not rational behavior.’ I ran into the bathroom and dry heaved.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“突然间，通用电气、卡特彼勒和波音公司在借钱发工资和支付供应商方面遇到了困难…… 每个人都在逃避各种形式的商业票据”，一位在纽约联储工作的律师告诉我。我们的一位高级经济学家说，“嗯，这不是理性行为。我跑进卫生间，干呕起来。”</p><p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-262" class="sect1">Shadow Money Is Real Money 影子货币是真实的货币</h1>

<p class="noindent">On Friday, three days after the Reserve Fund broke the buck, President George W. Bush gave a speech at the White House Rose Garden. “The Department of the Treasury is acting to restore  confidence in a key element of America’s financial system: money-market mutual funds,” the president said. Then he said the government was going to offer insurance for money-market funds.</p>

<p class="noindent">周五，在储备基金破发的三天后，乔治·W·布什总统在白宫玫瑰园发表了讲话。总统说：“财政部正在采取行动，以恢复人们对美国金融体系中一个关键因素的信心：货币市场共同基金。”然后他说，政府将为货币市场基金提供保险。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the 1930s, the government had put a fence around ordinary people’s bank accounts and said: Okay, what’s inside this fence is no longer a loan to the bank that you, the depositor, may or may not get back. Your bank deposit is your money. The government is going to insure the money inside this fence to make sure you get your money back. And we’re going to regulate the hell out of banks, and make them pay for the insurance, to keep that money safe.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 20 世纪 30 年代，政府曾在普通人的银行账户周围设置了一道围栏，并说。好吧，这道栅栏里面的东西不再是你这个储户向银行借的贷款，你可能会也可能不会拿回来。你的银行存款是你的钱。政府将为这个栅栏里的钱提供保险，以确保你能拿回你的钱。我们将对银行进行监管，并让他们支付保险费，以保证这些钱的安全。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Now, President Bush was essentially admitting that money&mdash;the thing the government had promised to keep safe&mdash;had jumped the fence. The dollars people had invested in money-market funds were no longer investments that people might or might not get back. They were now money, guaranteed by the United States, just like money in the bank or a gold coin in a locked box guarded by a soldier with a gun. “For every dollar invested in an insured fund, you will be able to take a dollar out,” the president said.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">现在，布什总统基本上承认，钱 —— 政府曾承诺要保持安全的东西 —— 已经跳出了围栏。人们在货币市场基金中投资的美元不再是人们可能得到或可能得不到的投资。它们现在是由美国担保的钱，就像银行里的钱或由持枪士兵看守的上锁盒子里的金币一样。总统说：“对于投资于保险基金的每一美元，你将能够取出一美元。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The president’s next sentence was boring but extraordinarily important: “The Federal Reserve is also taking steps to provide additional liquidity to money-market mutual funds, which will help ease pressure on our financial markets.” This was the other half of the money bargain, previously only available to banks: the Fed as lender of last resort. Now, the president was saying, the Fed stood ready to lend against the commercial paper that the money-market funds held and that nobody, but nobody, wanted to buy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">总统的下一句话很无聊，但却格外重要：“美联储还在采取措施，向货币市场共同基金提供额外的流动性，这将有助于缓解我们金融市场的压力。”这是货币交易的另一半，以前只对银行开放：美联储作为最后的贷款人。现在，总统说，美联储随时准备为货币市场基金持有的商业票据提供贷款，而没有人，但也没有人想买。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Two days later, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs&mdash;the last two freestanding big investment banks&mdash;became bank holding companies. That meant they now got all of the delicious Federal Reserve lending of last resort that classic banks could get. Citibank  and Bank of America, which had gotten into shadow banking by directing hundreds of billions of dollars into asset-backed commercial paper, would get bailouts in the form of hundreds of billions of dollars in government loans and guarantees in the months that followed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">两天后，摩根斯坦利和高盛 —— 最后两家独立的大型投资银行 —— 成为银行控股公司。这意味着它们现在可以获得传统银行可以获得的所有美味的美联储最后贷款。花旗银行和美国银行通过将数千亿美元投入资产抵押商业票据而进入影子银行，在随后的几个月里，它们将获得数千亿美元的政府贷款和担保的形式的救助。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Shadow banking, and the shadow money it created, managed to get all of the safety net, after going decades without paying any of the cost. Shadow money was now real money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">影子银行，以及它所创造的影子货币，在几十年没有支付任何成本的情况下，成功地获得了所有的安全网。影子货币现在是真正的货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Money-market funds survived, but the Reserve Fund did not. It was wound down, and investors received 99 cents on the dollar.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">货币市场基金活了下来，但储备基金却没有。它被清盘了，而投资者当初投资的 1 美元收回了 99 美分。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-265" class="sect1">Money and the Next Crisis 货币和下一次危机</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 2009, the Group of Thirty&mdash;an absurdly elite organization whose thirty members include Nobel Prize&ndash;winning economists, people who have run every major central bank in the world, and the heads of several of the planet’s biggest banks&mdash;suggested a future for money-market funds. If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, they said, we should regulate it like a duck.</p>


<p class="noindent">2009 年，三十国集团(Group of Thirty)提出了货币市场基金的未来，这个荒唐的精英组织的三十名成员包括诺贝尔经济学奖得主、管理过世界上所有主要中央银行的人以及地球上几家最大银行的负责人。他们说，如果它像鸭子一样走路，像鸭子一样游泳，像鸭子一样叫，我们就应该像鸭子一样监管它。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Money market mutual funds wishing to continue to offer bank-like services…” a report from the group said, “should be required to reorganize as special-purpose banks, with appropriate prudential regulation…” If, on the other hand, money funds didn’t want to be regulated like banks, they could stop letting people write checks on their accounts and stop showing a constant value of $1 per share&mdash;in short, they could stop acting like banks that held people’s money for safekeeping.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“希望继续提供类似银行服务的货币市场共同基金……”该小组的一份报告称，“应要求其重组为特殊目的银行，并进行适当的审慎监管……”另一方面，如果货币基金不想像银行一样被监管，他们可以不再让人们在他们的账户上开支票，不再显示每股 1 美元的恒定价值 —— 简而言之，他们可以不再像银行一样保管人们的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The companies that ran money-market mutual funds wanted to  keep acting like banks without being regulated like banks. “Fundamentally changing the nature of money market funds (and in the process eviscerating a product that has been so successful for both investors and the U.S. money market) goes too far and will create new risks,” an industry group wrote a few months later. (The use of “so successful” was an impressive show of chutzpah in 2009, less than a year after the run on money funds.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">经营货币市场共同基金的公司希望继续像银行一样行事，而不像银行一样被监管。几个月后，一个行业组织写道：“从根本上改变货币市场基金的性质（并在此过程中，将一个对投资者和美国货币市场都非常成功的产品彻底摧毁），这太过分了，并将产生新的风险。”(使用“如此成功”是 2009 年令人印象深刻的厚颜无耻的表现，在货币基金运行不到一年的时间里。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The government insurance issued during the crisis was allowed to expire once the crisis passed. People argued for years over what to do about money funds. In the end, some new rules were put in place, but the industry got much of what it wanted.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">危机期间发行的政府保险被允许在危机过去后失效。人们就如何处理货币基金的问题争论了多年。最后，一些新的规则出台了，但该行业得到了它想要的大部分东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Funds that are open only to big investors like companies and endowments do have to report daily swings in value, down to a fraction of a penny. But funds for ordinary investors still use the same accounting methods to show a constant dollar value for investors. People can still write checks on their accounts. Money-market funds are not regulated like banks, but for most people money in a money fund still feels like money in the bank.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">只对公司和捐赠基金等大投资者开放的基金确实必须报告每天的价值波动，小到一个便士的零头。但面向普通投资者的基金仍然使用相同的会计方法，为投资者显示恒定的美元价值。人们仍然可以在他们的账户上开出支票。货币市场基金不像银行那样受到监管，但对大多数人来说，货币基金里的钱仍然像银行里的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the spring of 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world, people once again started frantically pulling billions of dollars out of money-market funds. And the US government once again rushed to protect the funds. “It’s just frustrating that we never really fixed this stuff to begin with,” Sheila Bair, a former regulator, said. “The industry lobbyists came in and persuaded regulators to do half measures. And we’re back in the soup again.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">2020 年春天，随着冠状病毒大流行在世界各地蔓延，人们再次开始疯狂地从货币市场基金中提取数十亿美元。而美国政府再一次急于保护这些资金。“令人沮丧的是，我们从一开始就没有真正解决这个问题”，前监管者希拉·贝尔说。“行业游说者进来，说服监管机构采取半点措施。而我们又重新回到了汤里。”</p>

<p class="noindent">One essential lesson of the Panic of 2008 is this: follow the money. Not in the traditional sense of looking for the place where the money is going, but in the shadow money sense of looking for the  place where new kinds of quasi-money are being created. Look for the place where people are making loans that don’t feel like loans&mdash;they feel like money in the bank, which can be withdrawn at full face value at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class="noindent">2008 年恐慌的一个基本教训是：跟着钱走。不是传统意义上的寻找钱的去处，而是影子货币意义上的寻找新型准货币被创造的地方。寻找人们发放贷款的地方，这些贷款不像是贷款 —— 它们像是银行里的钱，可以在任何时候按面值提取。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-28">A Brief History of the Euro (and Why the Dollar Works Better) 欧元的简史（以及为什么美元更有效</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">We remember the fall of the Berlin Wall in a nostalgic haze. It was the beginning of that moment of sweet delusion, between the fall of the Soviet Union and the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, when the good guys had won and the bad guys had lost and Germany got to be one country again and everything was going to be okay.</p>

<p class="noindent">我们在怀旧的朦胧中记住了柏林墙的倒塌。那是在苏联解体与世贸中心和五角大楼遭到袭击之间的那个甜蜜妄想时刻的开始，当时好人赢了，坏人输了，德国再次成为一个国家，一切都会好起来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But at the time, the Germans’ neighbors were terrified. The French, British, and Soviets thought German reunification could bring back the aggressive, expansionist Germany that had destroyed Europe less than fifty years earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在当时，德国人的邻居们都感到很害怕。法国、英国和苏联认为，德国的统一可能会使不到五十年前摧毁欧洲的侵略性、扩张性的德国重新出现。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Help me to prevent German unification,” Mikhail Gorbachev told François Mitterrand, the president of France, when the wall came down. “Otherwise I will be replaced by a soldier; otherwise, you will bear the responsibility for war.” When Mitterrand met with Margaret Thatcher, she pulled out a map showing territories in Eastern Europe that had shifted from Germany to Poland after World War II. “They’ll take all of that, and Czechoslovakia, too,” she said.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“请帮我阻止德国的统一”，米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫在墙倒下时对法国总统弗朗索瓦·密特朗说。“否则，我将被一个士兵所取代；否则，你将承担战争的责任。”当密特朗与撒切尔夫人会面时，她拿出一张地图，显示二战后从德国转移到波兰的东欧领土。她说：“他们会拿走所有这些，还有捷克斯洛伐克。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> But Mitterrand didn’t want to push Germany away; he wanted to grab Germany in a European bear hug. And he wanted to use money to do it. He wanted to create a new kind of money managed not by a single country, but shared by a collective of European nations. It was a radical idea, but Mitterrand thought it was Europe’s only hope to avoid being economically dominated by Germany. “Without a common currency,” Mitterrand told Thatcher, “we are all of us&mdash;you and we&mdash;already subordinate to the Germans’ will.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但密特朗并不想把德国推开；他想用一个欧洲的熊抱抓住德国。他想用钱来做这件事。他想创造一种新的货币，不是由一个国家管理，而是由欧洲国家集体分享。这是一个激进的想法，但密特朗认为这是欧洲避免在经济上被德国支配的唯一希望。密特朗对撒切尔说：“如果没有共同的货币，我们作为一体，你和我们都已经服从于德国人的意志。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The story of how a bunch of countries gave up their own money and decided to share a single currency isn’t just about money. It’s about what it means to be a nation. At its center, the question boils down to this: What does a country lose when it gives up control over its money?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一群国家如何放弃自己的货币并决定共享一种单一货币的故事并不仅仅是关于钱。它是关于成为一个国家的意义。在其中心，这个问题可以归结为以下几点。当一个国家放弃对其货币的控制时，它将失去什么？</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-270" class="sect1">A Wild Experiment That People Didn’t Want to Admit Was a Wild Experiment</h1>
<p class="noindent">Less than a month after the fall of the wall, Mitterrand offered a deal to Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. If Germany agreed to a common currency, France would support reunification. If Germany didn’t agree, France would oppose reunification&mdash;and the UK and the Soviet Union would go along with France, leaving Germany surrounded as it was before World War I. “We will return to the world of 1913,” Mitterrand told Kohl.</p>

<p class="noindent">在隔离墙倒塌后不到一个月，密特朗向德国总理赫尔穆特·科尔提出了一项交易。如果德国同意采用共同货币，法国将支持统一。如果德国不同意，法国将反对统一，而英国和苏联将与法国一道，让德国像第一次世界大战前那样被包围。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Giving up a currency is a big deal for any country. For Germany, it was almost unimaginable. In the decades since World War II, the Germans had largely given up on nationalism (for good reason!) and focused instead on creating a strong economy and, above all,  stable money. They rebuilt their country around their currency, the deutschmark. “The deutschmark is our flag,” Kohl told Mitterrand. “It is the essential part of our national pride; we don’t have much else.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">放弃一种货币对任何国家来说都是一件大事。对德国来说，这几乎是难以想象的。在二战后的几十年里，德国人在很大程度上放弃了民族主义（理由很充分！），转而专注于创造一个强大的经济，最重要的是，稳定的货币。他们围绕着他们的货币 —— 德国马克重建了自己的国家。“德国马克是我们的旗帜”，科尔对密特朗说。“它是我们民族自豪感的重要组成部分；我们没有什么别的东西。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Europeans had been talking about sharing a currency for decades, but they hadn’t made much progress. Karl Otto Pöhl, the head of the Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, said he thought it would take a hundred years for Europe to get a single currency. When he was appointed to a committee on creating a shared currency, he read the newspaper in the middle of committee meetings to show his disdain. It was a dick move, but he did it for a reason: there were profound, seemingly irreconcilable differences in the way the French and the Germans thought money should work. Deciding suddenly to have the same money would be stranger than deciding suddenly to speak the same language. It would be more like deciding suddenly to have the same culture. How do you even do that?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">欧洲人几十年来一直在讨论共享一种货币，但他们没有取得多少进展。德国中央银行(Bundesbank)的负责人卡尔·奥托·波尔(Karl Otto Pöhl)说，他认为欧洲需要一百年的时间才能得到一种单一货币。当他被任命为一个创建共同货币的委员会时，他在委员会会议中间阅读报纸以表示他的不屑。这是一个混蛋的举动，但他这样做是有原因的：法国人和德国人认为货币的运作方式存在着深刻的、似乎不可调和的分歧。突然决定拥有同样的钱，比突然决定说同样的语言更奇怪。这将更像是突然决定拥有相同的文化。你是如何做到这一点的？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The French saw money as a tool elected officials should use to achieve their desired ends. France’s central bank, the Banque de France, took its orders from French politicians. The politicians often wanted to stimulate the economy by creating more money and driving down interest rates, even if it meant higher inflation.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">法国人把金钱看作是当选官员用来实现其理想目标的工具。法国的中央银行，法兰西银行，听从法国政治家的命令。政治家们经常希望通过创造更多的货币和降低利率来刺激经济，即使这意味着更高的通货膨胀。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Germans, on the other hand, thought money couldn’t be trusted to politicians. The temptation for the government to create more and more money, and drive inflation higher and higher, seemed too great. The Germans had lived through hyperinflation in the 1920s, when the value of the mark fell by the minute. People would walk into pubs and order two beers at once, because by the time they finished the first one, the price would have gone up for the second.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">另一方面，德国人认为不能把钱交给政治家。政府创造越来越多的货币，并使通货膨胀率越来越高，这种诱惑似乎太大了。德国人曾经经历过二十世纪 20 年代的恶性通货膨胀，当时马克的价值每分钟都在下降。人们会走进酒馆，一次点两杯啤酒，因为当他们喝完第一杯的时候，第二杯的价格就已经上涨了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Germans learned how tenuous the value of money is, and  after the war they rebuilt their economy around protecting that value. They were willing to suffer through recessions rather than risk inflation. Politicians appointed technocrats to run the central bank, the Bundesbank, and then left them alone. “Not all Germans believe in God,” a French politician said, “but they all believe in the Bundesbank.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">德国人了解到货币的价值是多么脆弱，战后他们围绕保护货币价值重建了经济。他们愿意忍受经济衰退，而不是冒着通货膨胀的风险。政治家们任命技术官僚来管理中央银行，即联邦银行，然后就不再管他们。“不是所有的德国人都相信上帝”，一位法国政治家说，“但他们都相信联邦银行。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">So when the technocrat running the Bundesbank got sent to some meeting to talk about giving up the deutschmark to share a currency with a bunch of flaky Europeans who didn’t know the value of money, he read the newspaper.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，当管理联邦银行的技术官僚被派去参加一些会议，讨论放弃德国马克，与一群不知道货币价值的欧洲人分享一种货币时，他读了报纸。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And when the French finance minister gave a speech to a roomful of German bankers in the fall of 1989, with the head of the Bundesbank sitting in the front row, he said: “No to technocracy! Yes to democracy! Central bankers have no right to be given superior authority!”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">而在 1989 年秋天，当法国财政部长对一屋子的德国银行家发表演讲时，联邦银行行长坐在前排，他说。他说：“反对技术主义！支持民主！中央银行家没有权利被赋予高人一等的权力！”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Three days after that speech, the Berlin Wall fell. President Mitterrand told Chancellor Kohl that Europe would let Germany be one Germany if Germany would let Europe have one currency. Kohl didn’t really have a choice; reunifying Germany was hard enough without worrying about a bunch of hostile neighbors. So he took the deal. The month after the fall of the Wall, Kohl went against the wishes of Germany’s central bank and many of its people and agreed to give up his country’s precious currency.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那次演讲后的第三天，柏林墙倒塌。密特朗总统告诉科尔总理，如果德国让欧洲拥有一种货币，欧洲将让德国成为一个德国。科尔其实别无选择；如果不担心一群敌对的邻国，统一德国已经很困难了。所以他接受了这个交易。围墙倒塌后的一个月，科尔违背了德国中央银行和许多人的意愿，同意放弃他国家的珍贵货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Pöhl, the head of the Bundesbank, started negotiating terms of surrender for the deutschmark. He wanted the new currency to be controlled by a European central bank that was run by technocrats whose main job was fighting inflation (not stimulating the economy), and who were not answerable to politicians. Ideally, the bank’s headquarters would be in Germany, for safekeeping. Basically, he  wanted to keep the deutschmark, but let other countries use it. But even that was not enough.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">联邦银行行长伯尔（Pöhl）开始就德国马克的投降条件进行谈判。他希望新的货币由一家欧洲中央银行控制，该银行由技术官僚管理，其主要工作是对抗通货膨胀（而不是刺激经济），并且不对政治家负责。理想情况下，该银行的总部将设在德国，以便于安全保管。基本上，他想保留德国马克，但让其他国家使用它。但即使这样也是不够的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The value of money, Pöhl and his colleagues explained in 1990, would soon depend on the actions of every single country that shared the currency. For the system to work, all the countries needed to keep deficits and inflation low. But in the long run that wouldn’t be enough. A common currency would only work, the German central bankers wrote, if the countries agreed to a “comprehensive political union”&mdash;if they became more like a single country, a United States of Europe.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">伯尔和他的同事们在 1990 年解释说，货币的价值将很快取决于共享货币的每个国家的行动。为了让这个系统发挥作用，所有国家都需要保持低的赤字和通货膨胀。但从长远来看，这是不足够的。德国中央银行家们写道，只有当各国同意建立一个“全面的政治联盟” —— 如果他们变得更像一个国家，一个欧洲合众国，共同货币才能发挥作用。

<p class="calibre9">The Europeans agreed to meet the first part of Pöhl’s demands. The new currency would be controlled by an independent central bank charged with fighting inflation, and headquartered in Germany. Citizens would be able to cross borders freely in order to work. But there wouldn’t be a single, overarching European government that collected taxes and redistributed money across the eurozone. The Europeans weren’t really ready to create a United States of Europe.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">欧洲人同意满足伯尔的第一部分要求。新货币将由一个独立的中央银行控制，负责对抗通货膨胀，总部设在德国。公民将能够自由跨越国界，以便工作。但不会有一个单一的、总括性的欧洲政府在整个欧元区征税和重新分配资金。欧洲人还没有真正准备好创建一个欧洲合众国。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So hundreds of millions of people were subjected to a wild experiment that no one in power admitted was a wild experiment: What happens when twelve countries, with vastly different economies, share a single kind of money?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">因此，数以亿计的人接受了一个疯狂的实验，没有一个当权者承认这是一个疯狂的实验。当十二个经济差异巨大的国家共享一种单一的货币时会发生什么？</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-274" class="sect1">The Euro Is a Miracle! 欧元是一个奇迹!</h1>

<p class="noindent">Just before midnight, on December 31, 2001, 10,000 people gathered around a statue of the euro symbol in Frankfurt, outside the headquarters of the new European Central Bank. At midnight,  euro bills and coins became legal tender. There were fireworks and speeches. The rollout, which involved printing billions of euro notes and changing over tens of thousands of ATMs, was a logistical triumph. By the end of February people had stopped using lira and francs and marks and pesetas and drachmas. For the first time since the fall of the Roman Empire, all of Western Europe was using the same kind of money.</p>

<p class="noindent">2001 年 12 月 31 日午夜前，在新的欧洲中央银行总部外的法兰克福，一万人聚集在一个欧元符号的雕像旁。午夜时分，欧元纸币和硬币成为法定货币。现场有烟花和演讲。这项工作涉及到印刷数十亿欧元的纸币和更换数以万计的自动取款机，是一项后勤工作的胜利。到 2 月底，人们已经停止使用里拉、法郎、马克、比塞塔和德拉克马。这是自罗马帝国灭亡以来，西欧第一次使用同一种货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The dream was coming true. Not just in the symbolic sense, of the pieces of paper with generic bridges on them, but in the economic sense as well. For a long time, people and governments in countries at the core of Western Europe (Germany, France, the Netherlands) had been able to borrow money more cheaply than those on the periphery (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece). The countries on the periphery had a history of higher inflation and higher deficits, and lenders demanded higher interest rates to compensate for that risk. Because low deficits and low inflation were conditions of entry into the euro, many governments on the periphery had pushed in the 1990s to bring down deficits and inflation. As they did that, they were able to borrow money more and more cheaply. Once countries joined the euro, European bank regulators started treating bonds of all eurozone governments equally; according to the officials, Greek bonds were exactly as safe as German bonds.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">梦想正在实现。不仅仅是在象征意义上，即那些印有通用桥梁的纸片，而且在经济意义上也是如此。长期以来，西欧核心国家（德国、法国、荷兰）的人民和政府能够比外围国家（葡萄牙、西班牙、意大利、希腊）更便宜地借到钱。外围国家有较高的通货膨胀和较高的赤字的历史，贷款人要求更高的利率来补偿这种风险。由于低赤字和低通货膨胀是加入欧元区的条件，许多外围国家的政府在 20 世纪 90 年代推动了降低赤字和通货膨胀。当他们这样做的时候，他们就能越来越便宜地借到钱。一旦各国加入欧元区，欧洲银行监管机构开始平等对待所有欧元区政府的债券；据官员们说，希腊债券与德国债券一样安全。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the early 2000s, when everyone started using the euro, interest rates had converged completely. Plotted on a graph, the coming of the euro looks like a miracle.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到二十一世纪初，当所有人开始使用欧元时，利率已经完全收敛。从图表上看，欧元的出现就像一个奇迹。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It wasn’t just that borrowing costs had converged. Some of the countries on the periphery of Europe were catching up with the core economically. Greece, Spain, and Ireland all saw faster-than-average economic growth for the first several years of the new  century. The eurozone wasn’t yet a single, integrated economy, but it was headed in the right direction. At least, that’s how it felt at the time.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这不仅仅是借贷成本趋同的问题。欧洲的一些边缘国家在经济上正在追赶核心国家。在新世纪的头几年，希腊、西班牙和爱尔兰的经济增长都超过了平均水平。欧元区还不是一个单一的、一体化的经济体，但它正朝着正确的方向发展。至少，当时的感觉是这样的。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-277" class="sect1">The Euro Is a Trap! 欧元是个陷阱!</h1>

<p class="noindent">In October 2009, Greece’s new prime minister stood before the country’s parliament and said the Greek government had been telling a massive lie about the amount of money the Greek government was borrowing and spending. The country’s deficit wasn’t 6 percent, as the previous government had said, but 12 percent.</p>

<p class="noindent">2009 年 10 月，希腊新任总理站在该国议会面前说，希腊政府在借贷和支出的金额上一直在撒大谎。该国的财政赤字并不像前政府所说的那样是 6%，而是 12%。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“The game is over,” the head of the group of eurozone countries said a few days later. He was just talking about the Greeks  monkeying with their economic data, but in retrospect the phrase also speaks to a much, much bigger game that was ending. You can see it if you stretch that miracle graph of interest rates out for a few more years.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“游戏结束了”，欧元区国家集团的负责人几天后说。他只是在谈论希腊人对他们的经济数据耍花招，但回过头来看，这句话也说明了一个更大的游戏正在结束。如果你把那个奇迹般的利率图再拉长几年，你就可以看到了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Suddenly, nobody thought lending money to Greece was the same as lending money to Germany. Pretty soon, they started worrying about Ireland and Portugal and, eventually, Spain and Italy as well.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">突然间，没有人认为借钱给希腊和借钱给德国是一样的。很快，他们开始担心爱尔兰和葡萄牙，最终也担心西班牙和意大利。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Rising interest rates were a potential deathtrap. In order to meet the higher interest payments, countries had to raise taxes or cut spending. This would make unemployment, which was already  high, go even higher. This, in turn, would mean lower tax revenues, which would make it harder to pay off the debt.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">利率的上升是一个潜在的死亡陷阱。为了满足更高的利息支付，各国不得不提高税收或削减开支。这将使原本就很高的失业率变得更高。这反过来又意味着税收收入减少，这将使偿还债务更加困难。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There was a traditional way out of this trap: the central bank created money and bought government bonds on the open market. This lowered interest rates, which encouraged businesses to borrow, invest, and hire more workers, which in turn led to more tax revenues, which made it easier for the government to pay its debt. There was another benefit, as well: the lower interest rates tended to drive down the value of the currency, which made the country’s exports cheaper for foreign buyers. Too much of this policy was a bad thing because it could make inflation grow out of control, but in moderation it led to more spending, more hiring, and more exports. It was the perfect solution to a financial crunch.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有一个传统的方法来摆脱这个陷阱：中央银行创造货币，在公开市场上购买政府债券。这降低了利率，鼓励企业借款、投资和雇用更多的工人，这反过来又导致了更多的税收，使政府更容易支付其债务。还有另一个好处：较低的利率倾向于推动货币贬值，这使得该国的出口对外国买家来说更便宜。这种政策太多是件坏事，因为它可能使通货膨胀失去控制，但在适度的情况下，它导致了更多的支出，更多的招聘，以及更多的出口。这是对金融紧缩的完美解决方案。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But Greece (and Spain and Portugal and Ireland) had given up the drachma (and the peseta and the escudo and the Irish pound). They did not have central banks to lower interest rates. They didn’t have a currency to devalue. They were stuck.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但希腊（以及西班牙、葡萄牙和爱尔兰）已经放弃了德拉克马（以及比塞塔、埃斯库多和爱尔兰镑）。他们没有中央银行来降低利率。他们没有货币可以贬值。他们被困住了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">So Greece asked the European Union for a bailout. In response, <em class="calibre4">Bild</em> , the most popular newspaper in Germany, did not cite the politicians who a few years earlier said “the common market and the euro make us strong.” Instead, the paper paraphrased a new proposal from a German lawmaker: “Sell your islands, bankrupt Greeks. And the Acropolis, too!”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">于是，希腊向欧盟请求救助。作为回应，德国最受欢迎的报纸《图片》（Bild）没有引用几年前说“共同市场和欧元使我们强大”的政治家。相反，该报转述了一位德国立法者的新提议。“卖掉你们的岛屿，破产的希腊人。还有雅典卫城！”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The narrative that took root was a classic. Countries needed bailouts because they were morally weak&mdash;especially Greece, which was in the most trouble. Countries on the periphery needed to learn the discipline of the countries in the core.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">扎根于此的叙述是一个经典。各国需要救助，因为它们在道德上是软弱的，尤其是希腊，它的麻烦最大。处于边缘的国家需要学习核心国家的纪律。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There were deep problems in Greece. Too many government employees were paid too much to do too little. As of 2010, to take one small example, there was a full-time staff of thirty people,  including a full-time driver for the director, to manage the draining of a lake northwest of Athens. Reasonable enough, except for the fact that the lake was drained in 1957.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">希腊的问题很深。太多的政府雇员工资太高，但做得太少。截至 2010 年，举个小例子，有 30 名全职工作人员，包括一名全职司机，负责管理雅典西北部的一个湖的排水工作。这很合理，除了这个湖在 1957 年就被排干了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Also, almost nobody paid their taxes. One example: Greece had a luxury tax on swimming pools. In the fancy suburbs north of Athens, 324 citizens duly paid taxes on their pools. Then tax officials looked at satellite photos of the area. They counted 16,974 pools.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">而且，几乎没有人交税。有一个例子。希腊曾对游泳池征收奢侈税。在雅典北部的豪华郊区，324 名公民为他们的游泳池适当地交了税。然后税务官员查看了该地区的卫星照片。他们数出了 16974 个游泳池。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There was something perversely delightful about details like these. For the sensationalists in the German press, the depraved Greeks were the perfect counterparts to hardworking, willing-to-suffer-to-keep-inflation-down Germans.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">像这样的细节，有一种反常的愉悦感。对于德国新闻界的耸人听闻者来说，堕落的希腊人是勤劳的、愿意忍受保持通货膨胀的德国人的完美对应物。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But there were problems with this narrative. For one thing, it lumped Greece, where the government had borrowed too much and lied, with Spain and Ireland, where the governments had run surpluses and the problems had come from speculation in banking and real estate.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但这种说法也有问题。首先，它将希腊与西班牙和爱尔兰混为一谈，前者的政府借了太多的钱，还撒了谎，后者的政府有盈余，问题来自于银行和房地产的投机活动。</p>

<p class="calibre9">More important, the narrative omitted entirely the way in which Germany had enabled&mdash;indeed, profited from&mdash;the borrowing and spending in Greece and the other eurozone countries that suddenly found themselves in trouble. Germany’s economy was driven by exports&mdash;largely by exports to other countries in the eurozone. But Germany didn’t buy that much stuff from the rest of Europe. If the countries had different currencies, this imbalance would have driven up the value of the deutschmark, which would have made German exports more expensive, and Europeans would have bought less German stuff. It was only because of the euro that this didn’t happen. German stuff stayed cheap because everybody was using the same money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">更重要的是，这种说法完全忽略了德国是如何使希腊和其他突然发现自己陷入困境的欧元区国家的借贷和支出得以实现&mdash;事实上，并从中获利。德国的经济是由出口驱动的，主要是对欧元区其他国家的出口。但德国并没有从欧洲其他国家购买那么多东西。如果这些国家有不同的货币，这种不平衡会推高德国马克的价值，这将使德国的出口更加昂贵，欧洲人会减少购买德国的东西。只是因为有了欧元，这种情况才没有发生。德国的东西一直很便宜，因为大家都在用同样的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The money from selling all this stuff to other Europeans was piling up in Germany. What did the Germans do with all that  money? They loaned it to the Southern Europeans so they could buy more stuff from Germany! German loans paid the salaries of the Greek government workers looking after the lake that didn’t exist, and the Spanish construction workers building empty housing developments in La Mancha. Then those workers went out and borrowed even more German money to buy Volkswagens or, if they borrowed a lot, Mercedes.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">把所有这些东西卖给其他欧洲人的钱都堆积在德国。德国人对这些钱做了什么？他们把钱借给了南欧人，这样他们就可以从德国购买更多的东西！德国的贷款支付了照顾希腊政府工作人员的工资。德国的贷款支付了希腊政府工作人员的工资，他们在照看根本不存在的湖泊，以及西班牙建筑工人在拉曼恰建造空荡荡的住房开发。然后，这些工人出去借更多的德国钱来买大众汽车，或者，如果他们借得多的话，买奔驰。</p>

<p class="calibre9">As with the gold standard a hundred years earlier, there was a desire to tell a simple morality tale, in this case about prudent savers in Northern Europe and wasteful borrowers in Southern Europe. But as with the gold standard, the story fell apart when you looked closely at what was going on. The prudent savers and the wasteful borrowers were two sides of the same coin. “After all,” the <em class="calibre4">Financial Times</em> columnist Martin Wolf wrote, “the borrowing would have been impossible without the lending. It is stupid to finance profligacy and then complain about the consequences of one’s own choices.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就像一百年前的金本位制一样，人们希望讲述一个简单的道德故事，在这种情况下是关于北欧谨慎的储蓄者和南欧浪费的借款者。但是，与金本位制一样，当你仔细观察发生的事情时，这个故事就不成立了。谨慎的储蓄者和浪费的借贷者是同一枚硬币的两面。“毕竟”，《金融时报》专栏作家马丁·沃尔夫写道，“如果没有贷款，借贷是不可能的。为暴利提供资金，然后抱怨自己选择的后果是愚蠢的。”</p><p>。

<h1 id="calibre_link-282" class="sect1">It’s My Money, I’ll Print More If I Want To 这是我的钱，如果我想的话，我会印更多。</h1>

<p class="noindent">What happened in Europe during these years was a lot like what happened in the United States in the wake of the financial crisis. And yet, as bad as the bust was in the United States, the bust was much, much worse in Europe. Europe’s economy suffered more, over a longer period of time, and unemployment in Europe rose higher and took years longer to fall. The difference in outcomes explains a lot about how money works, and why it’s so powerful for a country to have control over its own money.</p>

<p class="noindent">这些年欧洲发生的事情很像美国在金融危机后发生的事情。然而，与美国的萧条一样糟糕的是，欧洲的萧条要糟糕得多。欧洲的经济受到的影响更大，时间更长，欧洲的失业率上升得更高，而且花了更多的时间才下降。结果的差异解释了很多关于货币如何运作的问题，以及为什么一个国家对自己的货币拥有控制权是如此强大。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> In one way, the United States was like Southern Europe. Both were buying and borrowing from a foreign exporter. The Southern Europeans were sending euros to Germany in exchange for cars and machinery; the US was sending dollars to China in exchange for TVs and running shoes. China was lending a lot of those dollars back to the US (mostly in the form of Treasury bonds) so Americans could buy more stuff from China.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在某方面，美国就像南欧。两者都在向一个外国出口国购买和借贷。南欧人向德国发送欧元以换取汽车和机器；美国向中国发送美元以换取电视和跑鞋。中国将大量的美元借回给美国（主要是以国债的形式），因此美国人可以从中国购买更多的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But there was a crucial difference between the US and Southern Europe: the US was borrowing in dollars, a currency China had no control over. As a result, even though the US owed China a trillion dollars (a trillion dollars!), the US had the whip hand.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但美国和南欧之间有一个关键的区别：美国是用美元借款，而中国对这种货币没有控制权。因此，尽管美国欠中国一万亿美元（一万亿美元！），但美国手里有鞭子。</p>

<p class="calibre9">After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve launched a series of extraordinary interventions, creating trillions of new dollars out of thin air and, in the view of some critics (later shown to be wrong), threatening to drive up inflation and destroy the value of the dollar. This would also have destroyed the value of all those Treasury bonds China owned. But the Chinese had no say in US monetary policy. This is the beauty of borrowing in your own currency: it’s your money, and you can print more if you want to. This is what Greece, and Portugal, and Ireland, and Spain gave up when they joined the euro.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">金融危机之后，美联储发起了一系列非同寻常的干预措施，凭空创造了数万亿新美元，在一些批评者看来（后来证明是错误的），有可能推高通货膨胀，破坏美元的价值。这也会破坏中国拥有的所有那些国债的价值。但中国人对美国的货币政策没有发言权。这就是用自己的货币借款的好处：这是你的钱，如果你想，你可以印更多的钱。这就是希腊、葡萄牙、爱尔兰和西班牙加入欧元区时放弃的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The United States and Europe were both made up of states whose economies differed a lot from each other. Like Spain and Ireland, Florida and Nevada had booms in bank lending, home construction, and real estate prices, followed by banking crises, real estate busts, and high unemployment.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">美国和欧洲都是由经济差异很大的州组成的。像西班牙和爱尔兰一样，佛罗里达州和内华达州在银行贷款、房屋建设和房地产价格方面出现了繁荣，随后是银行危机、房地产萧条和高失业率。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But when the unemployment rate in Nevada neared 14 percent in 2010, hundreds of millions of dollars automatically flowed into the state from the federal government in the form of unemployment insurance and food stamps. This money came from taxpayers  all over the country, including places like Texas and Maine that largely avoided the boom and bust. Yet people in Texas and Maine didn’t complain about bailing out wasteful Nevadans. Newspapers didn’t write editorials attacking the profligate culture of Nevada and Arizona.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，当内华达州的失业率在 2010 年接近 14% 时，数亿美元的资金以失业保险和食品券的形式从联邦政府自动流入该州。这笔钱来自全国各地的纳税人，包括像德克萨斯州和缅因州这样基本避免了经济繁荣和萧条的地方。然而，德克萨斯州和缅因州的人们并没有抱怨拯救浪费的内华达人。报纸没有写社论攻击内华达州和亚利桑那州的挥霍文化。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Americans thought about the economy as Americans, not as New Yorkers or Oregonians or whatever, and rightly so. They paid far more in taxes to the federal government than they did to their state governments, and moved frequently from state to state, often to find work. They relied on a safety net funded mostly by the federal government, and the money they saved in the bank was guaranteed by the federal government, not by the states.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">美国人以美国人的身份思考经济问题，而不是以纽约人或俄勒冈人或其他什么人的身份思考，这样做是正确的。他们向联邦政府缴纳的税款远远多于向州政府缴纳的税款，而且经常从一个州搬到另一个州，常常是为了找工作。他们依赖一个主要由联邦政府资助的安全网，他们在银行里存的钱是由联邦政府而不是各州担保的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">None of this was true in Europe. Despite the fact that people could move freely around the eurozone for work, in practice Europeans crossed national borders much less frequently than Americans crossed state borders. The age at which workers could claim government pensions, and the generosity of those pensions, varied from country to country. (Greek workers, to take one example that proved problematic, could retire at a younger age and claim more generous pensions than German workers.) Each country had its own banking regulations and its own finance ministry.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在欧洲，这一切都不是真的。尽管人们可以在欧元区内自由流动工作，但实际上欧洲人跨越国界的频率远远低于美国人跨越州界的频率。工人可以申请政府养老金的年龄，以及这些养老金的慷慨程度，在不同的国家有所不同。(举个例子，希腊工人可以在更年轻的时候退休，并且比德国工人要求更慷慨的养老金，这证明是有问题的。）每个国家都有自己的银行法规和自己的财政部。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The Europeans&mdash;at least, the ones who believed in “ever closer union”&mdash;always meant to get around to creating a unified economy, with the same rules for everyone. They knew that, for the euro to work, Europe needed to be more like a single country. “It cannot be repeated often enough: Political union is the indispensable counterpart to economic and monetary union,” Chancellor Kohl had said years earlier. “Recent history, and not just that of Germany, teaches us that the idea of sustaining an economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">欧洲人 —— 至少，那些相信“越来越紧密的联盟” —— 总是意味着要建立一个统一的经济，对每个人都有相同的规则。他们知道，为了使欧元发挥作用，欧洲需要更像一个单一的国家。“这一点怎么重复都不为过。政治联盟是经济和货币联盟不可缺少的对应物”，科尔总理多年前曾说。“最近的历史，不仅仅是德国的历史，告诉我们，在没有政治联盟的情况下，长期维持经济和货币联盟的想法是一种谬论。”</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Europeans had been ignoring this fallacy for years. Now it was in their faces.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 欧洲人多年来一直无视这一谬论。现在它出现在他们的面前。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 2010, as unemployment hit 10 percent, the European Central Bank (ECB), there in Frankfurt with its Bundesbanky mission to keep prices in the euro area stable, did not create more money and lower interest rates in order to encourage businesses to borrow money and start hiring. Then, in 2011, the bank finally acted. But it did exactly the wrong thing, just like the Fed in 1931. It raised interest rates! It made things even worse!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">2010 年，当失业率达到 10% 时，在法兰克福的欧洲中央银行（ECB）肩负着保持欧元区价格稳定的使命，没有创造更多的货币和降低利率，以鼓励企业借钱和开始招聘。然后，在 2011 年，该银行终于采取行动了。但它完全做错了事，就像 1931 年的美联储。它提高了利率! 它使事情变得更加糟糕！</p>

<p class="calibre9">The ECB did collaborate with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund when they launched a series of bailouts in Greece, Portugal, and Ireland. But the money came with rules that forced governments to cut spending and raise tax rates, which in turn drove up unemployment and hurt the economy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当欧洲央行在希腊、葡萄牙和爱尔兰启动一系列救助措施时，确实与欧盟委员会和国际货币基金组织进行了合作。但是，这些钱伴随着迫使政府削减开支和提高税率的规则，这反过来又推高了失业率并损害了经济。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Greece, Portugal, and Ireland were all pretty small compared with the EU as a whole. It was clear they could limp along more or less forever on a series of underfunded bailouts, without taking the rest of Europe down with them. But in 2011, after the ECB raised interest rates, investors started getting really nervous about Spain and Italy, which were much bigger. They started demanding higher interest rates to lend to the Spanish and Italian governments, and the higher interest rates put those governments in an even more difficult economic spot. If rates kept rising, Spain and Italy might need bailouts, too&mdash;or they might be forced to crash out of the euro and go back to their old currencies, which would cause economic chaos.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">与整个欧盟相比，希腊、葡萄牙和爱尔兰都是相当小的国家。很明显，它们可以在一系列资金不足的救助中或多或少地永远跛行下去，而不会把欧洲其他国家也拖下水。但在 2011 年，欧洲央行提高利率后，投资者开始对规模更大的西班牙和意大利感到非常紧张。他们开始要求更高的利率来贷款给西班牙和意大利政府，而更高的利率使这些政府处于更加困难的经济境地。如果利率继续上升，西班牙和意大利可能也需要救助，或者他们可能被迫退出欧元区，回到他们的旧货币，这将导致经济混乱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The problem with Greece and Portugal had been a problem of political will; Europe and the IMF had enough money to bail out those countries. Spain and Italy were something else, though. Their combined government debts were over a trillion euros, far more than the EU and the IMF could credibly guarantee. They were so  much that, in order to guarantee them, you would literally need the power to print money out of thin air.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">希腊和葡萄牙的问题一直是一个政治意愿问题；欧洲和国际货币基金组织有足够的钱来救助这些国家。不过，西班牙和意大利的情况就不同了。它们的政府债务总额超过了一万亿欧元，远远超过了欧盟和国际货币基金组织可以相信的担保额。它们是如此之多，以至于为了担保它们，你简直需要有凭空印钱的能力。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Fortunately for Europe, there was an institution that could do that: the European Central Bank. The solution was to go back to Walter Bagehot’s nineteenth-century call for the central bank to lend into a panic. Rising interest rates were a self-fulfilling prophecy that could lead to economic collapse. Europe needed a central bank willing to act as lender of last resort&mdash;to prevent panic by buying up the bonds of troubled governments.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">对欧洲来说，幸运的是，有一个机构可以做到这一点：欧洲中央银行。解决办法是回到十九世纪沃尔特·巴盖特(Walter Bagehot)的呼吁，即中央银行应在恐慌中放贷。利率上升是一种自我实现的预言，可能导致经济崩溃。欧洲需要一个愿意充当最后贷款人的中央银行 —— 通过购买陷入困境的政府的债券来防止恐慌。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-287" class="sect1">Whatever It Takes 不惜代价</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 2011, an Italian economist named Mario Draghi took over as head of the ECB. He had been orphaned at fifteen and left to care for his younger siblings, studied for his PhD at MIT alongside Ben Bernanke, and been Italy’s finance minister through eleven different governments in ten years. He had the personal, intellectual, and political chops for the job.</p>

<p class="noindent">2011 年，一位名叫马里奥·德拉吉（Mario Draghi）的意大利经济学家接任欧洲央行行长。他 15 岁就成了孤儿，被留下来照顾弟弟妹妹，在麻省理工学院与本·伯南克一起攻读博士学位，并在 10 年内担任意大利的财政部长，经历了 11 届不同政府。他在个人、智力和政治方面都有能力胜任这项工作。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Draghi cut interest rates on his third day running the ECB, and cut them again a month later. The cuts helped, but they weren’t enough. In June 2012, Spain’s borrowing costs spiked to their highest level since the country had joined the euro. Italy’s borrowing costs were rising as well.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">德拉吉在执掌欧洲央行的第三天就降息，一个月后再次降息。降息有帮助，但还不够。2012 年 6 月，西班牙的借贷成本飙升至该国加入欧元区以来的最高水平。意大利的借贷成本也在上升。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“The future of the European Union will be played out in the next few days, perhaps in the coming hours,” the Spanish foreign minister said. He wanted the Germans to be scared, so he added: “If the Titanic sinks, it takes everyone with it, even those travelling in first class.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“欧盟的未来将在未来几天，也许是未来几个小时内上演”，这位西班牙外长说。他希望德国人感到害怕，所以他补充说：“如果泰坦尼克号沉没，它将带着每个人，甚至那些乘坐头等舱的人。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">The next month, Draghi was scheduled to speak on a panel in  London. It was no big deal; Draghi was in town to watch the Olympic opening ceremonies the next day. “No one had planned this to be an event of great significance,” another central banker who was on the panel said later. Just before the event, Draghi said to the other panelists: “Why don’t you take as much time as you want? I don’t want to say much.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二个月，德拉吉被安排在伦敦的一个小组中发言。这并不是什么大事；德拉吉是为了观看第二天的奥运会开幕式。“没有人计划将其作为一个具有重大意义的事件”，另一位参加小组讨论的央行官员后来说。就在活动开始前，德拉吉对其他小组成员说。“你们为什么不尽量多花点时间呢？我不想说太多。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the end, Draghi did not say much. But in the few minutes that he did speak, he said three words that changed the course of the euro crisis. For as long as Draghi is remembered at all, he will be remembered for those three words: “whatever it takes.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最后，德拉吉没有说什么。但在他发言的几分钟里，他说了三个词，改变了欧元危机的进程。只要人们还记得德拉吉，他就会因为这三个字而被人记住 —— “不惜一切代价”（<em>whatever it takes</em>）。

<p class="calibre9">“Within our mandate,” Draghi said, “the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.” Pause. “And believe me, it will be enough.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“在我们的授权范围内”，德拉吉说，“欧洲央行已经准备好做任何事情来维护欧元。”顿了一会，他接着说，“而且相信我，这将是足够的。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">That was it! Almost immediately, borrowing costs for Spain and Italy started falling. And they kept falling. Soon after that, Draghi expanded on his promise. The ECB announced a new program that allowed it to start buying the bonds of eurozone governments if there was a massive sell-off. The ECB did not actually have to buy the bonds through that program. The mere promise was enough to end the panic. Borrowing costs kept falling. The crisis was over.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这就是了! 几乎在同一时间，西班牙和意大利的借贷成本开始下降。而且他们一直在下降。此后不久，德拉吉就扩大了他的承诺。欧洲央行宣布了一项新计划，允许其在出现大规模抛售时开始购买欧元区政府的债券。欧洲央行实际上并没有必要通过该计划购买债券。仅仅是这个承诺就足以结束恐慌。借贷成本不断下降。危机结束了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the twenty-first century, it has become wildly clear that one of the most important things central bankers do is make promises that people believe. Draghi’s “whatever it takes” promise was meaningful not because it was followed by some bold action; the statement itself was the bold action. The people who were betting against the euro by dumping Spanish and Italian bonds suddenly saw that they were betting against a man who had the power to print unlimited euros to buy up those bonds&mdash;and who now said he was willing to do so. By promising to save the euro, Draghi saved the euro. That’s the magic trick! Money is trust; in the modern world,  where central banks have the ultimate power over money, money is trust in central bankers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在二十一世纪，人们已经非常清楚，央行行长最重要的事情之一就是做出人们相信的承诺。德拉吉的“不惜一切代价”的承诺之所以有意义，不是因为它后面有一些大胆的行动；声明本身就是大胆的行动。那些通过抛售西班牙和意大利债券来押注欧元的人突然发现，他们押注的对象是一个有能力无限制地印刷欧元来购买这些债券的人，而且他现在说他愿意这样做。通过承诺拯救欧元，德拉吉拯救了欧元。这就是神奇的把戏! 金钱就是信任；在现代世界，中央银行对金钱拥有终极权力，金钱就是对中央银行家的信任。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Mario Draghi swooping in to save the euro is the happy ending. The unhappy ending is this:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">马里奥·德拉吉猛扑过来拯救了欧元，这是一个圆满的结局。不愉快的结局是这样的：</p>

<p class="calibre9">A new kind of money that was born out of some combination of hope (for a united Europe) and fear (of a united Germany) had taken away the sovereignty of democratic countries that were home to hundreds of millions of people. Their money, and therefore their fate, was now in the hands of foreign central bankers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一种新的货币诞生于某种希望（对统一的欧洲）和恐惧（对统一的德国）的结合，它剥夺了拥有数亿人口的民主国家的主权。他们的钱，以及他们的命运，现在都掌握在外国中央银行家的手中。</p>

<a href="#calibre_link-12">The Radical Dream of Digital Cash 数字现金的激进梦想</a>
</h1>

<p class="noindent">Cash is a beautiful technology. It lets me walk up to a stranger, hand over a few pieces of paper, and walk away with an armload of stuff. The stranger doesn’t have to know anything about me. I don’t have to know anything about her. Nobody else has to know anything about our exchange. And we don’t need any record of the transaction. The cash itself is the record.</p>

<p class="noindent">现金是一项美丽的技术。它让我走到一个陌生人面前，递上几张纸，然后带着一捧的东西离开。陌生人不需要了解我的任何情况。我不需要了解她的任何情况。没有其他人需要知道我们之间的交流。而且我们不需要任何交易记录。现金本身就是记录。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Most money doesn’t work like this. The money in my checking account is just a number next to my name on the bank’s digital ledger. When I buy something with my debit card or pay a bill on my phone, a new entry is added to the ledger. Indeed, the new entry in the ledger (along with the corresponding entry in the ledger of the business that is getting paid) <em class="calibre4">is the payment</em>. No matter what the bank tells me, this is not a fundamentally private transaction. Maybe nobody will find out about it. Or maybe I’ll wind up in court, for one reason or another, forced by a government prosecutor or a disgruntled partner to disclose the checks I’ve written and the online payments I’ve made. Almost certainly, multiple  companies&mdash;Amazon, Visa, Chase&mdash;are piecing together parts of my ledger to figure out every single thing there is to know about me.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大多数钱都不是这样运作的。我支票账户里的钱只是银行数字账本上我名字旁边的一个数字。当我用借记卡买东西或用手机付账时，账本上就会增加一个新条目。事实上，账本上的新条目（以及获得付款的企业账本上的相应条目）<strong class="calibre4">就是付款</strong>。无论银行告诉我什么，这从根本上说不是一项私人交易。也许没有人会发现这一点。或者，也许我会在法庭上，因为这样或那样的原因，被政府检察官或心怀不满的合作伙伴强迫披露我所开的支票和我所做的在线支付。几乎可以肯定的是，多家公司 —— 亚马逊、维萨、大通 —— 正在拼凑我的部分账簿，以弄清关于我的每一件事。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the early 1980s, a computer scientist named David Chaum saw that the rise of cheap, powerful, networked computers was about to cause a huge shift away from anonymous, untraceable cash, and toward trackable ledger money. He was terrified and thought everybody else should be, too. “The foundation is being laid for a dossier society in which computers could be used to infer individuals’ life-styles, habits, whereabouts, and associations from data collected in ordinary consumer transactions,” he wrote in an absurdly prescient article in a journal published by the Association for Computing Machinery. “Some of our basic liberties may be threatened by computerization under the current approach.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">二十世纪 80 年代初，一位名叫大卫·乔姆（David Chaum）的计算机科学家看到，廉价、强大、联网的计算机的兴起将导致一个巨大的转变，即从匿名、不可追踪的现金转向可追踪的账本货币。他被吓坏了，并认为其他人也应该如此。他在计算机协会出版的杂志上写道：“正在为一个档案社会奠定基础，在这个社会中，计算机可以被用来推断个人的生活方式、习惯、行踪，以及从普通消费交易中收集的数据的关联。在目前的方法下，我们的一些基本自由可能会受到计算机化的威胁。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Chaum wasn’t just some hippie-ish Cassandra complaining about technology. I mean, he was those things&mdash;he had a ponytail, and a VW bus, and he hung out in Berkeley. But he wasn’t <em class="calibre4">just</em> those things. He also had a PhD in computer science from Berkeley and was a world expert in cryptography (the study of secret codes!) and security. And after years of technical work, he believed he had invented a new system that would let people live in the digital world without giving up their privacy. He had found a way to escape the tyranny of the bank ledger.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">乔姆并不只是一些嬉皮士式的乌鸦嘴（Cassandra）在抱怨技术。我的意思是，他是就是那些东西 —— 他有一个马尾辫，和一辆大众汽车，他在伯克利闲逛。但他并不是<strong class="calibre4">仅仅</strong>这些东西。他还拥有伯克利大学的计算机科学博士学位，是世界密码学（研究秘密代码！）和安全方面的专家。经过多年的技术工作，他相信自己已经发明了一个新的系统，可以让人们生活在数字世界中而不放弃自己的隐私。他已经找到了一种摆脱银行账簿暴政的方法。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In a technical article subtitled “Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete,” Chaum laid out a whole new way of being in the electronic world&mdash;a new way of communicating, identifying yourself, and, most important, a new way of buying stuff. He invented digital cash.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在一篇副标题为“让老大哥过时的交易系统”的技术文章中，乔姆提出了一种全新的电子世界存在方式 —— 一种新的沟通方式，识别自己，以及最重要的，一种购买东西的新方式。他发明了数字现金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the decades that followed, some of the biggest corporations on the planet&mdash;Microsoft, Citibank&mdash;would be drawn to Chaum. At the same time, a small group of radical libertarian programmers  also got interested in his ideas, which they thought would help create a stateless online paradise.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在随后的几十年里，地球上一些最大的公司 —— 微软、花旗银行 —— 将被乔姆吸引。同时，一小群激进的自由主义程序员也对他的想法感兴趣，他们认为这将有助于创造一个无国籍的网上天堂。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The giant corporations would spend millions of dollars in their quest to create proprietary digital cash. The radical programmers would work for free, often in their spare time, and would give their code away to anyone who wanted it. The corporations would ultimately fail; the radical programmers would succeed.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">巨大的公司将花费数百万美元来寻求创造专有的数字现金。激进的程序员将免费工作，往往是在他们的业余时间，并将他们的代码送给任何想要的人。这些公司最终会失败，而激进的程序员则会成功。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-293" class="sect1">When Digital Cash Was the New New Thing 当数字现金成为新事物的时候</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 1989, after a decade in academia, David Chaum decided to save privacy or get rich trying. He took the patents he’d accumulated over the previous decade (“a device which will assist in the performance of a financial transaction, yet secure the transactions details against covert inspection”) and started a company called DigiCash.</p>

<p class="noindent">1989 年，在学术界工作了十年之后，大卫·乔姆决定拯救隐私，或者尝试致富。他利用他在过去十年中积累的专利（《一种有助于进行金融交易的设备，但又能确保交易细节不受秘密检查》），成立了一家名为 <em>DigiCash</em> 的公司。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A generation before the iPhone was invented, at a moment when most people had never heard of the internet, Chaum imagined a world where you would carry around a little computer the size of a credit card. You would transfer cash from your bank account to your card&mdash;it would be just like withdrawing paper money. Stores would have card readers, to transfer cash from your account to theirs. The store’s computer would talk to the bank’s computer to verify that the electronic money was valid. But&mdash;and this is the clever part&mdash;Chaum figured out a system where the bank could verify the digital money without knowing the identity of the person using the money. You could buy stuff but stay out of Big Brother’s ledger. It was digital, anonymous money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 iPhone 发明之前的一代，在大多数人从未听说过互联网的时候，乔姆想象了这样一个世界：你将随身携带一台信用卡大小的小电脑。你可以将现金从你的银行账户转到你的卡上，这就像提取纸币一样。商店会有读卡器，将现金从你的账户转到他们的账户。商店的计算机将与银行的计算机对话，以验证电子货币是否有效。但是 —— 这是最聪明的部分 —— 乔姆想出了一个系统，银行可以在不知道使用这些钱的人的身份的情况下验证数字货币。你可以买东西，但不被老大哥的账本所记录。它是数字的、匿名的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Over the next few years, everybody suddenly decided digital cash was the next big thing. “Is e-money really going to happen? Inevitably,” <em class="calibre4">Wired</em> magazine inevitably wrote. “Hard currency has been a useful item for a few millennia or so, but now it has simply worn out its welcome.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 在接下来的几年里，每个人都突然决定数字现金是下一件大事。“电子货币真的会发生吗？不可避免的”，《连线》杂志不可避免地写道。“在几千年左右的时间里，硬通货一直是个有用的东西，但现在它根本已经不受欢迎了。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Cash is dying,” the <em class="calibre4">New York Times Magazine</em> said. “So here come Bitbux, E-Cash, Netchex, Cybercash, Netbills and Digicash, through the Patent and Trademark Office and into the marketplace.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“现金正在消亡”，《纽约时报杂志》说。“因此，Bitbux、E-Cash、Netchex、Cybercash、Netbills 和 Digicash 的出现，通过专利和商标局进入市场。”

<p class="calibre9">Microsoft is rumored to have offered Chaum millions to integrate DigiCash into Windows. Chaum turned the company down. Citibank visited Chaum, then worked for years on its own Electronic Monetary System. It was to be a new, digital currency, issued by the bank. The federal government tested it in secret for several years, including a pilot program in which government officials used Citi’s e-money to buy tens of thousands of Dell computers and collected taxes from a tobacco company&mdash;some $350 million in transactions.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">据传，微软曾向乔姆提供了数百万美元的资金，以便将 DigiCash 整合到 Windows 中。乔姆拒绝了该公司。花旗银行访问了乔姆，然后在自己的电子货币系统上工作了多年。这将是一种新的数字货币，由银行发行。联邦政府对其进行了几年的秘密测试，包括一个试点项目，政府官员使用花旗银行的电子货币购买了数万台戴尔电脑，并从一家烟草公司收取税款，交易额约为 3.5 亿美元。

<p class="calibre9">Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman who loved to warn against excessive regulation of everything, warned against excessive regulation of digital cash. “I am especially concerned that we not attempt to impede unduly our newest innovation, electronic money,” he said. (Much later, after the financial crisis, Greenspan would say that he had warned against regulation too much.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">喜欢警告不要对一切事物进行过度监管的美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘警告说，不要对数字现金进行过度监管。他说：“我特别关注的是，我们不要试图不适当地阻碍我们最新的创新 —— 电子货币。”（很久以后，在金融危机之后，格林斯潘会说，他曾警告过不要过度监管。）</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1994, Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the Web, invited Chaum to open the “First International Conference on the World Wide Web” in Geneva. By the end of 1995, DigiCash was working with banks in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, and Japan.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1994 年，发明网络的蒂姆·伯纳斯·李（Tim Berners-Lee）邀请乔姆在日内瓦主持“第一届万维网国际会议”的开幕式。到 1995 年底，DigiCash 已经与美国、瑞士、德国、澳大利亚和日本的银行合作。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The technology was in place. Massive financial institutions were behind it. All DigiCash needed was for people to use it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">技术已经到位。大规模的金融机构在背后支持它。DigiCash 所需要的是人们使用它。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> But despite what ordinary people said when you asked them about privacy (“We’re for it!”), people’s actions revealed they didn’t really care all that much about privacy. As people started buying stuff online, they didn’t bother with private digital cash. Instead, they used their credit cards. Eminently traceable, completely not secret, subject to significant fees. Also profoundly convenient.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，尽管普通人在你问他们关于隐私的问题时说“我们支持！”，人们的行动显示他们并不真的那么关心隐私。当人们开始在网上买东西时，他们并不理会私人数字现金。相反，他们使用他们的信用卡。显著的可追溯性，完全不是秘密，需要支付大量费用。而且还非常方便。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Citibank never rolled out its Electronic Money System to the public. DigiCash went bankrupt in 1997. Bitbux, Netchex, and Cybercash were never heard from again. “Electronic money has thus turned out to be a solution in search of a problem,” the <em class="calibre4">Economist</em> wrote in 1998 under the headline “Keep the Change.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">Citibank 从未向公众推出其电子货币系统。DigiCash 在 1997 年破产了。Bitbux、Netchex 和 Cybercash 再也没有消息了。1998 年，《经济学家》在“保持零钱”的标题下写道：“电子货币因此变成了寻找问题的解决方案”。

<p class="calibre9">But even as the corporate version of digital cash was dying, a loose group of libertarian programmers was using Chaum’s ideas as the core of a much more radical vision. They imagined a digital cash that wouldn’t just replace paper money; it would be better. They imagined a new kind of digital money that gave you all of the anonymity of cash, but with none of the constraints of paper and coins that have to be moved from place to place in the physical world. They realized digital cash could create a stateless libertarian paradise.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，即使在企业版的数字现金正在消亡的时候，一群松散的自由主义程序员正在使用乔姆的想法作为一个更激进的愿景的核心。他们想象的数字现金不仅仅是取代纸币，它还会更好。他们想象了一种新的数字货币，它能让你拥有现金的所有匿名性，但却没有纸币和硬币的限制，因为纸币和硬币必须在物理世界中从一个地方移动到另一个地方。他们意识到数字现金可以创造一个无国籍的自由主义天堂。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-296" class="sect1">Techno-Libertarians of the World, Unite! 世界上的技术自由主义者，团结起来!</h1>

<p class="noindent">Timothy May was a physicist and engineer who retired from Intel in 1986 at age thirty-four, bought a house outside Santa Cruz, and spent his days walking on the beach and reading like it was his job. He read science fiction and he read philosophy and he read lots of technical journals, and then one day he read David Chaum’s “Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete,” and it changed his  life&mdash;and, maybe, the history of money&mdash;forever. “This is it,” he thought. “This is the future.”</p>

<p class="noindent">蒂莫西·梅是一位物理学家和工程师，1986 年 34 岁时从英特尔公司退休，在圣克鲁斯郊外买了一栋房子，整天在海滩上散步和阅读，就像工作一样。他读科幻小说，读哲学，读大量的技术期刊，然后有一天他读到了大卫·乔姆的《让老大哥过时的交易系统》，这本书永远地改变了他的生活，也许还有货币的历史。“这就是它”，他想。“这就是未来。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">May was primed to have his mind blown by Chaum’s promise of digital cash. As an engineer, a libertarian, and a sci-fi fan, he grasped the technical details, the personal stakes, and the potential for profound social transformation. Indeed, his vision went even further than Chaum’s. So May did what you do when you’ve just discovered the thing that’s going to change the world and you don’t have a job and you’re living alone with a cat named Nietzsche: he wrote a manifesto.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">梅已经准备好让乔姆的数字现金承诺让他大开眼界。作为一名工程师、自由主义者和科幻迷，他掌握了技术细节、个人利害关系和深刻的社会变革的潜力。事实上，他的设想甚至比乔姆的设想更进一步。因此，当你刚刚发现了将会改变世界的东西，而你又没有工作，和一只名叫尼采的猫一起独居时，梅做了一件事：他写了一份宣言。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“A specter is haunting the modern world,” he began, allusive guns blazing, “the specter of crypto anarchy.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“一个幽灵正在困扰着现代世界”，他开始说，暗示性的枪声响起，“加密无政府状态的幽灵。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">May’s views were radical. He didn’t think taxes were too high. He opposed the very idea of taxes. He opposed democracy and resented the “clueless 95 percent” of society. The undermining of the US government sounded good to him. “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto”&mdash;wonky, grandiose, and a little bit tongue in cheek&mdash;was a call to like-minded radicals.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">梅的观点很激进。他不认为税收太高。他反对征税的想法本身。他反对民主，对社会上“无知的 95%”的人感到不满。对美国政府的破坏对他来说听起来不错。“隐秘的无政府主义者宣言” —— 时髦、宏大、有点口无遮拦 —— 是对志同道合的激进分子的呼吁。</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable.… These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, [and] the ability to tax and control economic interactions…</p>


<p class="blockquote-firstpara">两个人可以在不知道对方的真实姓名或法律身份的情况下交换信息、开展业务和谈判电子合同。在网络上的互动将是不可追踪的…… 这些发展将完全改变政府监管的性质，（以及）对经济互动进行征税和控制的能力……</p>

<p class="noindent2">The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded.… But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy…</p>

<p class="noindent2">国家当然会试图减缓或阻止这项技术的传播，理由是国家安全问题、毒贩和逃税者使用这项技术，以及对社会解体的担忧。其中许多担忧将是有效的；加密无政府状态将允许国家机密自由交易，并允许非法和被盗材料交易…… 但这不会阻止加密无政府状态的传播…… </p>

</div>
<p class="calibre9"> Weirdly, the manifesto worked.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 奇怪的是，这个宣言竟然起了作用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Not immediately, though. When May handed out photocopies at a cryptography event Chaum was hosting in Santa Barbara in 1988, nobody seemed interested. But over the next few years, a community of libertarian coders started to coalesce around May and his manifesto.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">不过，并不是马上就有了。1988 年，当梅在乔姆在圣巴巴拉举办的密码学活动中分发影印本时，似乎没有人感兴趣。但在接下来的几年里，一个由自由主义编码员组成的社区开始围绕着梅和他的宣言凝聚起来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1992, they got together at a house in Oakland. The house had just been bought by a mathematician named Eric Hughes, who was back from a stint working for Chaum in the Netherlands. At the gathering, everybody sat on the floor because Hughes hadn’t bought furniture yet. May opened the party by reading his manifesto. The crowd loved it. They played a cryptography game and had Thai food for dinner. People crashed on the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1992 年，他们在奥克兰的一所房子里聚在一起。这所房子刚被一个叫埃里克·休斯的数学家买下，他刚从荷兰为乔姆工作回来。在聚会上，大家都坐在地板上，因为休斯还没有买家具。梅以宣读他的宣言作为聚会的开始。众人都很喜欢。他们玩了一个密码学游戏，晚餐吃了泰国菜。人们瘫在地板上。</p>

<p class="calibre9">One of the people at the party, a journalist named Jude Milhon, thought the group needed a snappier, less scary-sounding name than “crypto anarchists.” She called them the cypherpunks. Like cyberpunks, but really into codes&mdash;cyphers.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">聚会中的一个人，一个叫裘德·米尔洪的记者，认为这个团体需要一个比“加密无政府主义者”更响亮、听起来不那么可怕的名字。她称他们为赛博朋克（cypherpunks）。就像 cyberpunks 一样，但他们真的很喜欢密码 —— cyphers。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The cypherpunks offered a broader tent than the crypto anarchists. And, crucially for our story, they weren’t just into philosophy. They wanted to write the code that would create the money that would change the world.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">赛博朋克提供了一个比加密无政府主义者更广泛的帐篷。而且，对我们的故事来说，至关重要的是，他们不仅仅是为了哲学。他们想编写代码，创造出能改变世界的货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“Privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system,” Eric Hughes wrote in 1992 in (wait for it) yet another manifesto. <em class="calibre4">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</em> was less grandiose and more focused than May’s manifesto. It was less of a declaration for the history books, more of a call to get to work.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“开放社会的隐私需要匿名交易系统。到目前为止，现金是主要的交易系统”，埃里克·休斯（Eric Hughes）于 1992 年在另一份宣言中写道（等等）。《赛博朋克宣言》（<em class="calibre4">A Cypherpunk's Manifesto</em>）没有梅的宣言那么宏大，更有针对性。它不像一个载入史册的宣言，更像是一个开始工作的呼吁。

<div class="blockquote">

<h1 id="calibre_link-300" class="sect1">Inventing Digital, Anonymous Cash Is Really Hard 发明数字、匿名现金真的很难</h1>

<p class="noindent">What the cypherpunks needed, out there on the virtual barricades of the digital revolution, was a kind of untraceable electronic cash that didn’t force them to trust a corporation like DigiCash, much less Microsoft or (God forbid) Citibank. What they needed was a kind of digital money that didn’t require them to trust anyone at all. They needed to be able to trust the money itself. Just like gold.</p>

<p class="noindent">在数字革命的虚拟街垒上，赛博朋克所需要的是一种无法追踪的电子现金，它不会迫使他们相信像 DigiCash 这样的公司，更不用说微软或（上帝禁止的）花旗银行。他们需要的是一种数字货币，不需要他们信任任何人。他们需要的是能够信任货币本身。就像黄金一样。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But this was a really hard thing to create. In the case of simple paper money, it hadn’t been easy. In that thousand-year-old paper bill from China, half of the space was given over to a warning that counterfeiting was punishable by death. And that bill itself was probably a counterfeit! The cypherpunks’ digital cash wouldn’t have the threat of state violence to scare counterfeiters away. And most ordinary digital files can be counterfeited by anyone who can type ctrl-c, ctrl-v.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但这是一个真正难以创造的东西。就简单的纸币而言，这并不容易。在那张来自中国的千年纸币上，有一半的篇幅被用来警告说造假会被判处死刑。而那张纸币本身很可能就是一张假币! 赛博朋克的数字现金不会有国家暴力的威胁来吓跑造假者。而大多数普通的数字文件都可以被任何能够输入 ctrl-c、ctrl-v 的人仿冒。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was an extraordinarily hard technical problem. And yet, true to the manifesto (“cypherpunks write code”), cypherpunks started writing the code.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这是一个特别难的技术问题。然而，正如宣言所言（"赛博朋克写代码"），赛博朋克们开始写代码。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> The first breakthrough came five years after that initial cypherpunk meeting, from a British professor named Adam Back. He was trying to solve a problem that was driving everybody crazy back in the mid-’90s: email spam.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 第一个突破出现在最初的赛博朋克会议五年之后，来自一位名叫亚当·贝克的英国教授。他试图解决一个在 90 年代中期让所有人都发疯的问题：电子邮件垃圾邮件。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The cypherpunks used software that allowed them to send email anonymously. But that same software was catnip for spammers, who used it to send millions of unblockable junk emails. In 1997, Back emailed the cypherpunk list to share a program he’d written that “would put spammers out of business overnight.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">赛博朋克使用的软件允许他们匿名发送电子邮件。但是，同样的软件也是垃圾邮件发送者的猫腻，他们用它来发送数百万封无法阻止的垃圾电子邮件。1997 年，拜克（Back）给赛博朋克列表发了电子邮件，分享他写的一个程序，“可以让垃圾邮件发送者在一夜之间失去业务。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">A few years earlier, two computer scientists named Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor had published a paper called “Pricing via Processing, or Combatting Junk Mail.” The basic idea was to require computers to do a tiny bit of computational work before sending an email. The work might take a few seconds&mdash;short enough to be irrelevant for ordinary people, but long enough to destroy the business model of spammers who had been sending thousands of emails per minute.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几年前，两位名叫辛西娅·德沃克（Cynthia Dwork）和莫尼·瑙尔（Moni Naor）的计算机科学家发表了一篇名为《通过处理定价，或打击垃圾邮件》的论文。其基本思想是要求计算机在发送电子邮件之前做一些微小的计算工作。这项工作可能需要几秒钟，短到与普通人无关，但长到足以摧毁那些每分钟发送成千上万封邮件的垃圾邮件发送者的商业模式。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Back put this idea into practice by requiring computers sending emails to perform a type of computation called a “hash.” In Back’s system, coming up with the right hash was hard&mdash;the email sender’s computer had to do a lot of work. But once the answer had been discovered, it was easy for another computer to verify that it was correct. So Back made the email sender’s computer do the hard computational work and add the solution to the outgoing email. Then the recipient’s computer verified that the hash was correct. Back called the program hashcash. Versions of hashcash were adopted by a bunch of anti-spam software programs, including one released by Microsoft.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">拜克将这个想法付诸实践，要求发送电子邮件的计算机进行一种叫做“哈希”的计算。在拜克的系统中，想出正确的哈希值是很难的 —— 电子邮件发送者的计算机必须做大量的工作。但是，一旦答案被发现，另一台计算机就很容易验证它是否正确。因此，拜克让电子邮件发送者的计算机做艰苦的计算工作，并将解决方案添加到发出的电子邮件中。然后，收件人的计算机就会验证这个哈希值是否正确。拜克称这个程序为“哈希现金”（hashcash）。哈希现金的版本被许多反垃圾邮件软件所采用，包括微软发布的一个。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Hashcash solved problem number one for creating digital money: how to prevent computers from creating infinite amounts of money.  David Chaum had first taken a crack at the problem by relying on a central institution, such as a bank. But the cypherpunks’ dream was to embed scarcity in digital money itself so that buyers and sellers wouldn’t need to trust any central institution. Back’s proposal was an elegant solution. Anyone who wanted hashcash had to put in some computational work to get it. The cost of the electricity to power that computation, tiny as it might seem, created scarcity.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">哈希现金解决了创造数字货币的头号问题：如何防止计算机创造无限量的货币。 大卫·乔姆首先通过依靠中央机构（如银行）来解决这个问题。但加密主义者的梦想是将稀缺性嵌入数字货币本身，这样买家和卖家就不需要信任任何中央机构。Back 的提议是一个优雅的解决方案。任何想要哈希现金的人都必须付出一些计算工作才能得到它。为该计算提供动力的电力成本，尽管看起来很微小，却创造了稀缺性。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Chaum’s digital money was like fiat currency, controlled by a central bank. Back’s was more like gold, at least in one respect: just as anyone with the resources and the will could mine gold, anyone with the resources and the will could create hashcash.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">乔姆的数字货币就像法币，由中央银行控制。拜克的数字货币更像黄金，至少在一个方面：正如任何有资源和意愿的人都可以开采黄金一样，任何有资源和意愿的人都可以创造哈希现金。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But there was also an essential way in which hashcash was not like gold&mdash;a way in which it wouldn’t work as the digital money the coders needed to make their cypherpunk dreams come true. Each hashcash “postage stamp” was customized for a particular email recipient and could only be used once. So it wouldn’t work as money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，哈希现金还有一个重要的特点，那就是它不像黄金 —— 它不能作为编码者需要的数字货币来实现他们的赛博朋克梦想。每个哈希现金“邮票”都是为特定的电子邮件收件人定制的，只能使用一次。所以它不能作为货币使用。</p>

<p class="noindent">The cypherpunks were up against what felt like a paradox. To create digital money they had to prevent someone from spending the same money twice, or three times, or a hundred times. The classic way to do this was by keeping track of everyone’s balance on a ledger. They could make the ledger anonymous to protect users’ privacy&mdash;that was what Chaum had done. But they still needed some trusted intermediary to maintain the ledger, to keep track of everything.</p>

<p class="noindent">赛博朋克们面对的是一个感觉上的悖论。为了创造数字货币，他们必须防止有人把同样的钱花两次，或三次，或一百次。做到这一点的经典方法是在一个账本上记录每个人的余额。他们可以让账本匿名，以保护用户的隐私 —— 这就是 Chaum 所做的。但他们仍然需要一些可信赖的中介机构来维护账本，以跟踪所有的事情。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 1998, a coder named Wei Dai suggested an upside-down solution. Maybe we don’t need a single, central intermediary to maintain the ledger. Maybe we make <em class="calibre4">everybody</em> maintain the ledger. The way to create anonymous digital money is for everybody to know everything all the time&mdash;every balance, every payment, at  every moment. “Every participant maintains a (separate) database of how much money belongs to each pseudonym,” Dai wrote. “These accounts collectively define the ownership of money.” Dai called it b-money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">1998 年，一位名叫戴伟的编码员提出了一个颠覆性的解决方案。也许我们不需要一个单一的、中央的中介机构来维护账本。也许我们让<strong class="calibre4">每个人 everybody</strong>维护账本。创造匿名数字货币的方法是让每个人在任何时候都知道一切 —— 每一笔余额，每一笔付款，在每一个时刻。“每个参与者都维护着一个（独立的）数据库，其中有多少钱属于每个假名”，戴伟写道。“这些账户共同定义了金钱的所有权”。戴伟称其为“<em>B-money</em>”.</p>。

<p class="calibre9">As in hashcash, computers would generate b-money by solving puzzles. When a computer belonging to a user&mdash;call her Alice&mdash;solved a puzzle, the computer would send the answer to everyone on the network. Everyone would verify the answer, and credit Alice’s account in the ledger with newly created b-money.</p>

< class="calibre9">就像在哈希现金中一样，计算机将通过解谜产生“b-money”。当属于一个用户的计算机解决了一个谜题，该计算机将把答案发送给网络上的所有人。每个人都会验证这个答案，并将新创建的“b-money”记入爱丽丝在分类账中的账户。

<p class="calibre9">And if Alice wants to pay someone&mdash;call him Bob&mdash;five b-money bucks, Alice sends a message to the computers of everyone who uses b-money: “I, Alice, am paying Bob five bucks.” Everybody’s computer first checks to make sure that Alice has at least five bucks in her account. If she doesn’t, her message is ignored. If she does, then everybody’s computer deducts five bucks from Alice’s account and adds five bucks to Bob’s account. And the payment is made. (For anonymity, people’s accounts are not listed in their own names, but in codes of letters and numbers.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果 Alice 想付给某人 —— 叫他 Bob —— 五块“b-money”，Alice 会向每个使用“b-money”的人的电脑发送一个信息。"我，爱丽丝，要付给鲍勃五块钱"。每个人的计算机首先检查以确保爱丽丝的账户中至少有 5 美元。如果她没有，她的信息就会被忽略。如果她有，那么每个人的电脑都会从爱丽丝的账户中扣除 5 美元，并在鲍勃的账户中增加 5 美元。然后付款就完成了。(为了匿名，人们的账户不以他们自己的名字列出，而是以字母和数字的代码列出。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was beautiful, but there was a flaw, and it was obvious to Dai from the start. The system was “impractical, because it makes heavy use of a synchronous and unjammable anonymous broadcast channel.” In other words, everybody has to be online all the time communicating to each other instantaneously and without interruption. Otherwise, somebody could miss a transaction sent out across the network and then the ledgers wouldn’t match, so you couldn’t figure out who had how much money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">它很美，但有一个缺陷，而且从一开始就被戴伟看出来了。该系统是“不切实际的，因为它大量使用了同步和不可干扰的匿名广播渠道”。换句话说，每个人都必须一直在线，即时地、不间断地相互交流。否则，有人可能会错过在网络上发出的交易，然后账簿就会不匹配，所以你无法弄清楚谁有多少钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The cypherpunks kicked Dai’s idea around. A few of them built on it. One guy described a system called “bit gold”; another wrote code for what he called “reusable proofs of work,” which built off hashcash.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">哈希现金把戴伟的想法传来传去。他们中的一些人在此基础上有所发展。一个人描述了一个叫做“比特金”的系统；另一个人为他所谓的“可重复使用的工作证明”写了代码，它建立在哈希现金之上。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Then, in August 2008, Wei Dai got an email from a stranger. “I was very interested to read your b-money page,” it began. “I’m getting ready to release a paper that expands on your ideas into a complete working system. Adam Back (hashcash.org) noticed the similarities and pointed me to your site.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 然后，在 2008 年 8 月，戴炜收到一封来自陌生人的电子邮件。“我非常有兴趣阅读你的‘b-money’页面”，它开始说，“我正准备发布一篇论文，将你的想法扩展为一个完整的工作系统。亚当·拜克（hashcash.org）注意到了这些相似之处，并指给我看你的网站。” </p>

<p class="calibre9">The paper’s working title, included in the email to Dai, was “Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.” Two months later, the stranger published the paper online with an updated title. It was called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这篇论文的工作标题，包括在给戴的电子邮件中，是《没有可信第三方的电子现金》。两个月后，这个陌生人在网上发表了这篇论文，并更新了标题。它被称为《比特币：一个点对点的电子现金系统》。 </p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-305" class="sect1">Bitcoin! 比特币！</h1>

<p class="noindent">The stranger who invented bitcoin was almost certainly not named Satoshi Nakamoto, but that was the name on the top of the bitcoin paper, and the name in the email to Wei Dai, and the name the creator (or creators) of bitcoin used to talk up bitcoin on the crypto email lists. Nobody knew then, and nobody knows as I write this, who Satoshi Nakamoto is (or are) or was (or were).</p>

<p class="noindent">发明比特币的陌生人几乎可以肯定不叫中本聪，但这是比特币论文上面的名字，也是给戴伟的电子邮件中的名字，也是比特币的创造者（或创造者们）在加密货币电子邮件列表中用来谈论比特币的名字。当时没有人知道，在我写这篇文章时，也没有人知道中本聪是是谁（们），当然也不知道他（们）是否还活着。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Satoshi Nakamoto could be a cypherpunk living in an underground bunker in New Zealand or an executive at a bank in London. She might be a priest or he might be a criminal or they might be a cabal scheming to take over the world. But fundamental to the genius of bitcoin is this: it doesn’t matter at all who Satoshi Nakamoto is.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">中本聪可能是一个住在新西兰地下掩体里的赛博朋克，或者是伦敦一家银行的高管。她可能是一个牧师，他可能是一个罪犯，或者他们可能是一个阴谋夺取世界的阴谋。但是，比特币的天才之处在于：中本聪是谁一点都不重要。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It would be catastrophic if the CEO of a bank was delusional, or the chairman of the Federal Reserve was inclined to commit fraud. Those institutions depend on the choices made by the people in charge. The point of bitcoin is that no one is in charge. (You could also say that everyone is in charge, but that amounts to the same  thing.) In classic cypherpunk style, Satoshi (“Satoshi”) owns no patents on bitcoin. The full codebase was published online for everyone to see and use and tweak however they want.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果一家银行的首席执行官有妄想症，或者美联储主席有欺诈的倾向，那将是灾难性的。这些机构取决于负责人的选择。比特币的意义在于，没有人是负责人。(你也可以说，每个人都在负责，但这相当于同样的事情。）在典型的赛博朋克风格中，中本聪（“Satoshi”）对比特币不拥有任何专利。完整的代码库被公布在网上，让每个人都可以看到，并使用和调整他们想要的东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Money is always and everywhere based on trust. Modern currency is based on trust in the government that issues it. Bitcoin is also based on trust. But the dream of bitcoin is that you don’t have to trust a government, or a bank, or Satoshi Nakamoto; you just have to trust the code.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">货币总是无所不在，也只能基于信任。现代货币是基于对发行它的政府的信任。比特币也是建立在信任的基础上。但比特币的梦想是，你不必相信政府、银行或中本聪；你只需相信代码。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And the code for bitcoin is very clever! Satoshi took ideas from Back’s hashcash and Wei Dai’s b-money and added to them a few brilliant twists that seemed to make bitcoin the thing cypherpunks had been dreaming of for years: an anonymous(ish), money(ish) thing that buyers and sellers could exchange over the internet without any bank or tech company in the middle. Satoshi laid out the whole thing in that nine-page paper he published on Halloween 2008.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">而且比特币的代码非常聪明! 中本聪从拜克的“哈希现金”和戴伟的“b-money”中吸取了一些想法，并在其中加入了一些精彩的转折，这似乎使比特币成为赛博朋克们多年来梦寐以求的东西：一个匿名的，钱一样的东西，买家和卖家可以在互联网上交换，没有任何银行或技术公司在中间。中本聪在 2008 年万圣节发表的那篇 9 页的论文中阐述了整个事情。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bitcoin would run on a ledger maintained by everyone. When Alice wanted to give Bob five bitcoins, she would send a message to everyone, as with b-money, using her pseudonymous private key, saying: “Dear Everyone, I’m giving Bob five bitcoins.” Then everyone on the network would update their universal ledger and move the bitcoins into Bob’s account.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比特币将在一个由所有人维护的账本上运行。当 Alice 想给 Bob 五个比特币时，她会像“b-money”一样，用她的假名私钥向所有人发送一条信息，说。“亲爱的大家，我给 Bob 五个比特币。”然后网络上的每个人都会更新他们的通用账本，并将比特币转移到 Bob 的账户。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was the system that Wei Dai had thought up&mdash;and rejected as impractical because it required everybody to keep their computers running and connected to each other and processing this giant ledger all the time. Why would anybody want to do that? Satoshi’s answer to that question is maybe the most important innovation in bitcoin: the computers that were running and talking to each other and keeping track of the bitcoin ledger would get paid in newly created bitcoin for doing that work.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这是戴伟想出来的系统，但被认为不切实际，因为它要求每个人都保持他们的计算机运行，并相互连接，一直处理这个巨大的账本。为什么会有人愿意这样做呢？中本聪对这个问题的回答可能是比特币中最重要的创新：那些正在运行的、相互交谈的、跟踪比特币账本的计算机将因为做这些工作而得到新创造的比特币的报酬。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> It works like this:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">它是这样工作的：</p>


<ul class="calibre12">
<li class="calibre5">Every new transaction gets broadcast out to the network.</li>

<li class="calibre5 cn">每笔新交易都会被广播到网络上。</li>

<li class="calibre5">All the computers in the network are recording those transactions and, at the same time, trying to solve a computational puzzle. (The puzzle-solving idea goes back to Adam Back’s hashcash.)</li>

<li class="calibre5 cn">网络中的所有计算机都在记录这些交易，同时，试图解决一个计算难题。(解谜的想法可以追溯到亚当·拜克的哈希现金。)</li>

<li class="calibre5">The first computer to solve the puzzle sends the solution, along with a record of the most recent transactions on the ledger, out to all the computers on the network. This record of transactions is known as a block.</li>

<li class="calibre5 cn">第一台解开谜题的计算机将解决方案连同账本上最近的交易记录一起发送给网络上的所有计算机。这个交易记录被称为区块。</li>

<li class="calibre5">The computers on the network check to confirm that the solution to the puzzle is correct. Once they see that it is, they begin again, recording new transactions in a new block and trying to solve the next computational puzzle.</li>

<li class="calibre5 cn">网络上的计算机检查以确认谜题的解决方案是否正确。一旦他们看到它是正确的，他们就会重新开始，在一个新的区块中记录新的交易，并试图解决下一个计算谜题。</li>

<li class="calibre5">Each block of transactions is linked to the block that came before. In this way, all transactions in the history of bitcoin are linked together forever. In the white paper, Satoshi called this a “chain of blocks.” It would soon get the slightly shorter, significantly snappier name “blockchain.”</li>
</ul>

<li class="calibre5 cn">每个交易区块都与之前的区块相连。这样一来，比特币历史上的所有交易就永远联系在一起了。在白皮书中，中本聪称这是一条“区块链”。它很快就得到了一个稍短的、明显更快的名字“区块链”。</li>

<p class="calibre9">In early 2009, Satoshi published the source code for bitcoin. Anyone who wanted to, anywhere in the world, could download the code to their computer and start solving computational puzzles, packaging blocks of transactions, and winning bitcoin.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 2009 年初，中本聪公布了比特币的源代码。世界上任何地方的任何人都可以把代码下载到他们的电脑上，开始解决计算难题，打包交易区块，并赢得比特币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The winner for each block would get 50 bitcoins&mdash;which, at the time, was worth nothing at all. But at least, at the beginning, it was easy to win. “I made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will  be able to generate coins in just a few hours,” Satoshi wrote in an early email to a crypto group. If more people joined the network, the difficulty would rise so that, no matter how many computers were on the bitcoin network trying to solve problems, a new block of transactions would be created every 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">每个区块的赢家将得到 50 个比特币 —— 在当时，这根本不值一提。但至少，在开始的时候，它很容易赢。“我让工作证明的难度在开始时简单得令人发指，所以在开始的一段时间里，一台普通的 PC 将能够在短短几个小时内产生硬币”，中本聪在给一个加密货币团体的早期电子邮件中写道。如果有更多的人加入网络，难度就会上升，这样一来，无论比特币网络上有多少台电脑试图解决问题，每 10 分钟就会产生一个新的交易区块。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Like gold, the amount of bitcoins that would ever exist in the world would be finite&mdash;21 million in total. They would be awarded according to a strict schedule written into the code. For the first four years, the winner for each block would get 50 bitcoins. For the four years after that, the prize would go down to 25 bitcoins per block. It would be halved every four years, down into fractions of bitcoins, until finally, in the year 2140, the last fraction of the 21 millionth bitcoin would be created. “When that runs out,” Satoshi wrote, “the system can support transaction fees if needed.” Satoshi was already taking a very long view.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就像黄金一样，世界上存在的比特币的数量是有限的 —— 总共 2100 万枚。它们将根据写在代码中的一个严格的时间表被授予。在最初的四年里，每个区块的赢家将得到 50 个比特币。之后的四年，奖金将下降到每个区块 25 个比特币。它将每四年减半，降为比特币的零头，直到最后，在 2140 年，第 2100 万个比特币的最后一个零头将被创造。“当这些钱用完后”，中本聪写道，“如果需要，系统可以支持交易费用。”中本聪已经把眼光放得很远了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Just before the bitcoin code was released, Satoshi had created the first block of bitcoin. With perhaps a bit more drama than is absolutely necessary, it came to be called the “genesis block,” and it contained a little extra text: a front-page headline from the <em class="calibre4">Times of London</em> from January 3, 2009. It has been suggested that this was to prove that the genesis block was created on or after that date, in the same way a kidnapping victim is photographed holding up today’s newspaper to prove he’s still alive. But the choice of this particular headline, from this particular newspaper, conveys more than just the date:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">就在比特币代码发布之前，中本聪已经创建了比特币的第一个区块。也许有一点戏剧性，它被称为“创世区块”，它包含了一点额外的文字：2009 年 1 月 3 日《伦敦时报》的头版标题。有人认为，这是为了证明创世块是在该日期或之后创建的，就像绑架受害者被拍到举着今天的报纸以证明他还活着一样。但是，从这份特定的报纸上选择这个特定的标题，传达的不仅仅是日期：</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bitcoin was a real technical advance. It solved a set of problems that had vexed really smart people for twenty years, and it allowed for digital cash without a trusted intermediary. But bitcoin also benefited from arriving on the scene in the middle of the financial crisis, a moment when hundreds of millions of people who had never paid much attention to the meaning of money suddenly found themselves much less trustful of trusted intermediaries.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比特币是一个真正的技术进步。它解决了一系列困扰了真正的聪明人二十年的问题，而且它允许在没有可信的中介的情况下实现数字现金。但是，比特币也得益于在金融危机中出现，在这个时刻，数以亿计的人从未关注过金钱的意义，突然发现自己对可信的中介机构的信任度大大降低。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” Satoshi wrote to a message board in February 2009. “The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“传统货币的根本问题是使其运作所需的所有信任”，中本聪在 2009 年 2 月在一个留言板写到。“必须相信中央银行不会贬低货币，但法定货币的历史充满了对这种信任的破坏。必须信任银行持有我们的钱并以电子方式转移，但他们在一波又一波的信贷泡沫中把钱借出去，几乎没有一点储备。我们必须相信他们能保护我们的隐私，相信他们不会让身份窃贼盗用我们的账户。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">At a moment when trust was at a low point, bitcoin seemed to solve the problem of trusting other people to make money work. All you had to do was trust the code. But in the end, bitcoin would prove as dependent on the messiness of humans as every other kind of money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在信任处于低谷的时刻，比特币似乎解决了信任他人使钱发挥作用的问题。你所要做的就是相信代码。但最终，比特币将被证明与其他任何一种货币一样依赖于人类的混乱。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-310" class="sect1">How Much Is One Bitcoin Worth? 一个比特币值多少钱？</h1>

<p class="noindent">When you have a new kind of money, and it’s not convertible at a fixed rate to dollars, or to gold, or to anything else, how much is that new kind of money worth? There are two obvious answers:</p>

<p class="noindent">当你有一种新的货币，而且它不能以固定的汇率与美元、黄金或其他任何东西进行兑换时，这种新的货币价值多少？有两个明显的答案：</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre5">Whatever people will pay for it</li>
<li value="1" class="calibre5 cn">人们愿意为它支付的无论多少</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre5">Nothing</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre5 cn">一文不值</li>
</ol>

<p class="calibre9">If you want to be pedantic about it, you could say that number 2 is a subset of number 1, but in any case, number 2 is what prevailed with bitcoin for kind of a long time. In 2010, more than a year after the first bitcoins were created, the coder and early bitcoin supporter Gavin Andresen created a site he called “bitcoin faucet” that gave people five bitcoins for free, just for showing up at the site and setting up their own bitcoin address. “No catch&mdash;I want Bitcoin to be successful, so I created this little service to give you a few coins to start with,” Gavin wrote on the site.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果你想迂腐一点，你可以说数字 2 是数字 1 的一个子集，但无论如何，数字 2 是比特币在很长一段时间内的主流。2010 年，在第一个比特币诞生一年多后，编码员和早期的比特币支持者加文·安德烈森创建了一个网站，他称之为“比特币水龙头”，给人们免费提供 5 个比特币，只需在该网站出现并设置自己的比特币地址。加文在网站上写道：“没有陷阱 —— 我希望比特币能够成功，所以我创建了这个小服务，给你一些硬币来开始。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Around the same time, a guy in Jacksonville, Florida, named Laszlo Hanyecz decided it was time for someone, somewhere on planet Earth, to do with bitcoin what you are supposed to do with money: buy something. So he did the obvious thing. He posted a note to the main bitcoin forum at 12:35 in the morning under the subject line “Pizza for bitcoin?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">大约在同一时间，佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔的一个名叫拉斯洛·汉耶茨（Laszlo Hanyecz）的人决定，是时候让地球上某个地方的人用比特币做你应该用钱做的事情了：买东西。所以他做了一件很明显的事情。他在凌晨 12:35 在比特币的主论坛上发了一个帖子，主题是“用比特币买披萨？”</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="noindent1">I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place.… If you’re interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.</p>

<p class="noindent1">我会为几个披萨支付 10,000 比特币…… 比如可能是 2 个大的，这样我就能为第二天剩下一些。我喜欢有剩余的比萨饼，以后可以啃。你可以自己做披萨，然后送到我家，或者从一个送货的地方为我订购…… 如果你有兴趣，请告诉我，我们可以制定一个交易。</p>

<p class="noindent2">Thanks,</p>

<p class="noindent2">谢谢,</p>

<p class="noindent2">Laszlo</p>

<p class="noindent2">拉斯洛</p>

</div>

<p class="calibre9">A few days later, a nineteen-year-old in California hit Laszlo  up via internet chat. Laszlo sent him 10,000 bitcoins and the teenager called a Papa John’s in Jacksonville and ordered two pizzas with everything to be delivered to Laszlo’s house (he paid with a credit card). How much was bitcoin worth at this point? Figure $30 worth of pizza for 10,000 bitcoins, which means each bitcoin was worth a third of a cent. It rounds down to nothing.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几天后，加利福尼亚的一个 19 岁少年通过网络聊天打给了拉斯洛。拉斯洛给他发了 10,000 比特币，这个少年给杰克逊维尔的一家 Papa John's 打电话，订了两个披萨，所有东西都送到了拉斯洛的家里（他用信用卡付款）。这时的比特币值多少钱？计算一下，价值 30 美元的比萨饼为 10,000 个比特币，这意味着每个比特币价值三分之一美分 —— 四舍五入后等于就没有了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was obviously a stunt, and to call those pizzas the first thing ever bought with bitcoin seems sort of iffy, but I want to give it to Laszlo. It’s a fun stunt, and it captures the spirit of a particular bitcoin moment in its lightness and hope and silliness and insiderness. The guys in the AV club were setting up the PA system, tapping the mic, and singing goofy songs to each other in an empty room. “Is this thing on?”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这显然是个噱头，把这些披萨称为有史以来第一件用比特币购买的东西似乎有点不靠谱，但我想把它交给拉斯洛。这是一个有趣的噱头，它捕捉到了一个特殊的比特币时刻的精神，它的轻松、希望、傻气和内敛。AV 俱乐部的人正在设置扩音系统，敲击麦克风，在一个空荡荡的房间里互相唱着愚蠢的歌曲。“这东西开着吗？” </p>

<p class="calibre9">The show was about to start for real. People were about to start buying stuff with bitcoin, and the scene was about to get darker. It was the kind of thing the cypherpunks had been dreaming of for twenty years&mdash;and it was brought to life by a true believer from a new generation.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">演出即将真正开始。人们要开始用比特币买东西了，而且这个场景要变得更黑暗了。这是赛博朋克二十年来梦寐以求的事情，它被一个来自新一代的真正信徒带到了现实中。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-312" class="sect1">Bitcoin Gets Dark 比特币黑化了</h1>

<p class="noindent">“For years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted,” someone calling himself the Dread Pirate Roberts wrote in 2012. It was a typical sentiment for a thoughtful twentysomething struggling to find a place in the world, which is what the Dread Pirate had been&mdash;until he discovered his purpose.</p>

<p class="noindent">“多年来，我被今天的世界和我想要的世界之间似乎无法逾越的障碍所挫败”，一个自称“恐惧海盗”的人在 2012 年写道。这是一个有思想的 20 多岁的年轻人的典型情绪，他们努力在这个世界上找到自己的位置，这就是恐惧海盗曾经的情况 —— 直到他发现自己的目的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“But eventually I found something I could agree with whole  heartedly. Something that made sense, was simple, elegant, and consistent in all cases.” What he had found was a thread of radical libertarianism called anarcho-capitalism that held that the market was freedom, and government was tyranny. The noble thing to do, Roberts decided, was to fight tyranny by doing business on the black market.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“但最终我找到了我可以全心全意同意的东西。一些有意义的东西，简单、优雅，而且在所有情况下都是一致的。” 他所发现的是一种被称为无政府资本主义的激进自由主义路线，认为市场就是自由，而政府就是暴政。罗伯茨决定，要做的崇高事情是通过在黑市做生意来对抗暴政。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Dread Pirate Roberts realized that his purpose in life was to start a website where people could buy drugs. And he quickly saw that bitcoin&mdash;pseudonymous digital cash&mdash;was the way to make it work.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">可怕海盗罗伯茨意识到，他的人生目标是建立一个人们可以购买毒品的网站。他很快就发现，比特币 —— 假名数字现金 —— 是实现这一目标的途径。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He called the site Silk Road. It was a marketplace that matched buyers and sellers (aka dealers) of everything illegal to put in your body: weed, ecstasy, opioids, psychedelics, whatever. Listings had a Craigslist vibe, only druggier:</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他把这个网站称为丝绸之路。这是一个匹配买家和卖家（又称经销商）的市场，提供一切可以放入体内的非法物品：大麻、摇头丸、阿片类药物、迷幻药，等等。房源有一种 Craigslist 的感觉，只是毒品更多：</p>

<p class="ul-list">“5gr UNCUT Crystal Cocaine!!”</p>

<p class="ul-list">"5gr 未剪切水晶可卡因！"</p>

<p class="ul-list">“HIGH QUALITY #4 HEROIN ALL ROCK.”</p>

<p class="ul-list">"高质量的#4 海洛因全岩石状。" </p>

<p class="calibre9">In at least one way, money is like anything else: when demand increases faster than supply, the price goes up. Now that people had a reason to want bitcoin, the price of bitcoin relative to dollars started to rise. By early 2011, you could exchange one dollar for one bitcoin. After the website Gawker published the first mainstream story about Silk Road in June, the exchange rate spiked to more than $30 per bitcoin.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">至少在一个方面，货币和其他东西一样：当需求的增加快于供应时，价格就会上升。现在人们有了想要比特币的理由，相对于美元，比特币的价格开始上涨。到 2011 年初，你可以用一美元兑换一个比特币。在 Gawker 网站于 6 月发布了第一个关于丝绸之路的主流故事后，汇率飙升至每枚比特币 30 美元以上。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 2013, the FBI arrested a man named Ross Ulbricht, who they said was the Dread Pirate Roberts, the creator of Silk Road. Ulbricht was tried and found guilty of drug trafficking and conspiracy to commit money laundering. “The stated purpose [of Silk Road] was to be beyond the law,” the judge said at Ulbricht’s sentencing. “In  the world you created over time, democracy didn’t exist.” She gave him life in prison without parole.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">2013 年，联邦调查局逮捕了一个名叫罗斯·乌尔布里特（Ross Ulbricht）的人，他们说他是“可怕海盗”罗伯茨，即“丝绸之路”的创建者。乌尔布里特被审判并被认定犯有贩毒和共谋洗钱罪。法官在对乌尔布里希特的判决中说：“丝绸之路的既定目的是超越法律。在你长期创造的世界里，民主并不存在。”她判处他终身监禁，不得假释。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-315" class="sect1">Anarcho-Capitalism, But Without the Anarchy 无政府资本主义，但没有无政府状态</h1>

<p class="noindent">In 2013, just a month after Ulbricht was arrested, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had a hearing on bitcoin. Everyone dutifully cited all the bad things people were doing with bitcoin. And then, sort of shockingly, the mood in the room changed. A Justice Department lawyer testified that there were “many legitimate uses” of bitcoin. “These virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal,” he said. A Treasury Department official who dealt with financial crime sounded more like a bland venture capitalist. “Innovation is a very important part of our economy,” she said. <em class="calibre4">The Washington Post</em> called it a “love fest.”</p>

<p class="noindent">2013 年，就在乌尔布里特被捕一个月后，参议院国土安全委员会举行了一次关于比特币的听证。每个人都尽职尽责地列举了人们用比特币做的所有坏事。然后，有点令人震惊的是，房间里的气氛变了。司法部的一名律师作证说，比特币有“许多合法用途”。“这些虚拟货币本身并不违法”，他说。一位负责处理金融犯罪的财政部官员听起来更像是一位平淡无奇的风险投资家。“创新是我们经济的一个非常重要的部分”，她说。《华盛顿邮报》称这是一场“爱的盛宴”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">What was going on?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">发生了什么？</p>

<p class="calibre9">Silicon Valley had started to seize on bitcoin as the next big thing. There was less bitcoiny talk about ending the tyranny of democracy and more about offering lower transaction fees for online purchases. “The appeal of zero transaction costs is really strong and extremely disruptive for a massive industry, the payments industry,” a venture capitalist told the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> in May 2013. (“Extremely disruptive” and “massive industry” are venture-capital speak for “there are boatloads of money to be made here.”)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">硅谷已经开始将比特币作为下一个大事情来抓。关于结束民主暴政的比特币言论较少，而更多的是关于为网上购物提供更低的交易费用。2013 年 5 月，一位风险资本家告诉《华尔街日报》，“零交易成本的吸引力真的很强，对一个庞大的行业，支付行业来说，是极具颠覆性的。”(“极度颠覆性”和“庞大的行业”是风险资本的说法，即“这里有大量的钱可赚”。) </p>

<p class="calibre9">This view lacked the world-historical punch of the crypto anarchist manifesto, but it was very exciting to rich people seeking to become more rich. Also, lower transaction fees would be good for everybody except the payments companies currently  collecting high transaction fees. Millions of dollars in venture capital started flowing into start-ups that were making bitcoin wallets and bitcoin exchanges and “Buy with Bitcoin” buttons for online merchants.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这种观点缺乏加密无政府主义宣言的世界历史冲击力，但它对寻求变得更富有的富人来说是非常令人兴奋的。另外，除了目前收取高额交易费的支付公司，较低的交易费对所有人都有好处。数百万美元的风险资本开始流入那些制造比特币钱包和比特币交易所以及为在线商家提供“用比特币购买”按钮的初创公司。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was anarcho-capitalism, but without the anarchy. Bitcoin, weirdly, had become sort of normal. As it became clear bitcoin was legit, and wasn’t about to get shut down or disappear, more people began exchanging dollars for bitcoin. The exchange rate between dollars and bitcoin shot up to over $500 around the time of the Senate hearing.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这是无政府资本主义，但没有无政府状态。比特币，奇怪的是，已经变得有点正常了。当人们发现比特币是合法的，并且不会被关闭或消失时，更多的人开始用美元兑换比特币。在参议院听证会期间，美元和比特币之间的汇率飙升至 500 美元以上。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People started building special computers optimized to mine bitcoin&mdash;to attack the problems that the bitcoin software used to award new bitcoins. Then they started filling giant warehouses full of racks of those mining computers. The computers sucked up so much energy that miners began seeking out places in the world where power was cheap, to lower their costs of mining. Vast mining operations sprung up in Iceland, Mongolia, and, especially, China.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">人们开始建造特殊的计算机，并对其进行优化，以挖掘比特币 —— 来计算比特币软件用来奖励新比特币的问题。然后他们开始在巨大的仓库里装满了这些挖矿电脑的架子。这些电脑耗费了大量能源，矿工们开始寻找世界上电力便宜的地方，以降低他们的挖矿成本。在冰岛、蒙古，特别是中国，出现了大量的采矿业务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">All this growth led to a new problem. Actually an old problem, now newly urgent. The bitcoin network could only process about five transactions per second. The Visa network, by comparison can process 24,000 transactions per second. This was not a technology that was about to become the new world currency.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">所有这些增长导致了一个新问题。实际上是一个老问题，现在是新的紧急情况。比特币网络每秒钟只能处理大约五笔交易。相比之下，Visa 网络每秒可以处理 24,000 笔交易。这并不是一项即将成为新的世界货币的技术。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bitcoin was, among other things, a piece of software&mdash;lines of code, written in the programming language C++, that anyone in the world could download and do whatever they wanted with. Like all software, bitcoin would need to be tweaked over time. And a fairly straightforward tweak would have solved the transaction limit problem, by allowing each block to include more transactions.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">除此之外，比特币是一个软件 —— 很多行代码，用编程语言 C++编写，世界上任何人都可以下载并做他们想做的事情。像所有的软件一样，比特币需要随着时间的推移进行调整。一个相当直接的调整将解决交易限制的问题，允许每个区块包括更多的交易。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But as with many tweaks, there would be a trade-off. The larger  block size would make it harder for ordinary people to download and run bitcoin software, pushing bitcoin further away from the decentralized, egalitarian ideal and more toward a corporate, consolidated future. Was the trade-off worth it?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，就像许多调整一样，会有一个权衡。更大的区块大小将使普通人更难下载和运行比特币软件，使比特币进一步远离去中心化、平等主义的理想，而更多地走向企业、合并的未来。这种权衡值得吗？</p>

<p class="calibre9">If bitcoin were run by a company, the CEO would have had some meetings, talked to customers, weighed the costs and benefits, and decided whether to make the tweak. But bitcoin is not run by a company. There is no CEO. The whole point is that nobody is in charge. So who decides what changes to make? Everybody!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">如果比特币是由一家公司运营，首席执行官会开一些会议，与客户交谈，权衡成本和效益，并决定是否进行调整。但是，比特币不是由一个公司管理的。没有 CEO。整个问题的关键是没有人在负责。那么，谁来决定做什么改变呢？每个人！</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bitcoin is democratic. The official blockchain is whatever most of the computer processors mining bitcoins say it is. On top of that, anyone who wants to can take the bitcoin code, tweak it, and create their own, new and improved version of bitcoin. This sounds like chaos, and it kind of is, and that was kind of the point of bitcoin all along.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比特币是民主的。官方的区块链是大多数开采比特币的计算机处理器所说的。除此之外，任何想要的人都可以采用比特币的代码，对其进行调整，并创造他们自己的、新的和改进的比特币版本。这听起来很混乱，而且确实如此，而这正是比特币一直以来的意义所在。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The fight over increasing the transaction limit&mdash;making the bitcoin network faster but less democratic&mdash;became known as the “bitcoin civil war,” and it was partly about whether and when bitcoin was really going to function as money. In one camp were people who thought the most important thing about bitcoin was that it be easy to use to buy stuff. This is a good feature for money to have! These were the people who wanted to increase the block size.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">关于提高交易限额的斗争 —— 使比特币网络更快但不那么民主 —— 被称为“比特币内战”，它的部分原因是比特币是否以及何时能真正作为货币发挥作用。在一个阵营中，有人认为比特币最重要的事情是它可以很容易地用来买东西。这是一个很好的货币功能。这些人希望增加区块大小。</p>

<p class="calibre9">People in the other camp wanted to make sure anybody who wanted to could download and run the bitcoin software. These people talked about bitcoin more like gold&mdash;this scarce valuable thing&mdash;that we shouldn’t mess with too much. And, they said, even with small blocks there would eventually be a technical solution to the transaction problem. (The idea was to build software that would sort of sit on top of the core bitcoin layer and reduce the number of transactions that needed to go through the core system.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">另一个阵营的人想确保任何想下载和运行比特币软件的人。这些人把比特币说得更像黄金 —— 这种稀缺的有价值的东西 —— 我们不应该搞得太多。而且，他们说，即使是小区块，最终也会有一个技术解决方案来解决交易问题。（他们的想法是建立一个软件，在比特币核心层之上，减少需要通过核心系统的交易数量。）</p>

<p class="calibre9"> There were summits and meetings and agreements, then changes to the agreements, and in the end everybody sort of gave up on agreeing. The big blockers launched a rival currency, which they called bitcoin cash, that allowed for far more transactions per second than bitcoin. The small blockers stuck with bitcoin. Everybody stayed mad at everybody else. They never worked it out.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 峰会、会议和协议，然后是对协议的修改，最后大家都放弃了达成协议。大的区块生产者（矿工）推出了一个竞争对手的货币，他们称之为比特币现金，它允许每秒钟的交易量远远超过比特币。小块头们坚持使用比特币。每个人都在生其他人的气。他们从来没有解决过这个问题。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Over these same years, people launched hundreds of alternative cryptocurrencies. They all ran on blockchains but had their own tweaks. They promised better anonymity or a stable value relative to the dollar. They promised whole new kinds of businesses built on top of the blockchain. Some of these coins developed huge followings and billion-dollar valuations. Most failed and became known as shitcoins.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这些年里，人们推出了数百种替代加密货币。他们都在区块链上运行，但有自己的调整。他们承诺提供更好的匿名性或相对于美元的稳定价值。他们承诺在区块链的基础上建立全新的业务。这些硬币中的一些发展了巨大的追随者和 10 亿美元的估值。大多数都失败了，被称为“狗屎币”。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Eventually, Facebook and the Chinese government started developing their own digital currencies. In other words, a technology originally conceived to “make Big Brother obsolete” was now being advanced by a company built on gathering immense amounts of data on billions of people, and a state built on surveillance of its citizens. But as of early 2020, neither Facebook nor China had launched a digital currency.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">最终，Facebook 和中国政府开始开发自己的数字货币。换句话说，一项最初被设想为“让老大哥过时”的技术，现在正被一家以收集数十亿人的大量数据为基础的公司和一个以监视其公民为基础的国家推进。但截至 2020 年初，Facebook 和中国都没有推出数字货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This new universe was expanding, but bitcoin remained at the center, far more valuable than any other cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这个新的宇宙正在扩大，但比特币仍然处于中心位置，远比其他加密货币更有价值。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By the beginning of 2020, Chinese miners had grown so large that they controlled most of the processing power on the bitcoin network. And the way the code for bitcoin was written gave them control over the system. The people who controlled those computers in China weren’t algorithms. They were human beings with feelings and egos, and they could direct the future of bitcoin.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到 2020 年初，中国矿工的规模已经大到控制了比特币网络的大部分处理能力。而比特币的代码编写方式让他们控制了整个系统。在中国控制这些电脑的人并不是算法。他们是有感情和自我的人，他们可以引导比特币的未来。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“I used to think that bitcoin was just ‘Trust the math, trust the code,’” Gavin Andresen, the coder and early bitcoin evangelist told  me. “My mind has changed about that. There is a community. There is consensus. There are people.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“我曾经认为比特币只是‘相信数学，相信代码’”，"代码员和早期的比特币布道者加文·安德烈森告诉我。“我对这一点的看法已经改变了。有一个社区。有共识。还有人。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">Andresen&mdash;the first person Satoshi handed the code to, who gave away thousands of bitcoins because he believed so much in the process&mdash;eventually got so tired of the bitcoin civil war that he left the bitcoin world altogether. (For the record, in the bitcoin civil war, Andresen believed in bigger blocks.)</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">安德烈森 —— 是中本聪最先把代码交给了他，他送出了成千上万的比特币，因为他非常相信这个过程 —— 最终厌倦了比特币内战，他完全离开了比特币世界。(为了记录在案，在比特币内战中，安德烈森相信更大的区块。) </p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-320" class="sect1">The Price of Bitcoin 比特币价格</h1>

<p class="noindent">As the nerds were fighting over the future of bitcoin, the exchange rate between bitcoins and dollars rose, then it rose some more, then it got completely ridiculous. A little later, it fell but remained much higher than it had been. Even after the crash, you could exchange a single bitcoin for thousands of dollars.</p>

<p class="noindent">在书呆子们为比特币的未来争论不休的时候，比特币和美元之间的汇率上升了，然后又上升了一些，然后变得完全荒谬。稍后，它下降了，但仍然比原来高得多。即使在崩溃之后，你也可以用一个比特币换取数千美元。</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was generally seen as a good thing by people who were excited about bitcoin, not least because they had already exchanged dollars for bitcoins and&mdash;their belief in the inevitable failure of the dollar notwithstanding&mdash;they were excited by the future prospect of exchanging their bitcoins for many, many, many more dollars. Simply put, the people who bought bitcoin early got rich, and this made them happy about bitcoin.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这被那些对比特币感到兴奋的人普遍认为是一件好事，主要是因为他们已经用美元兑换了比特币，而且 —— 尽管他们相信美元不可避免的失败 —— 他们对未来用比特币兑换很多很多很多美元的前景感到兴奋。简单地说，早期购买比特币的人发了财，这让他们对比特币感到高兴。</p>

<p class="calibre9">And yet! For people who wanted bitcoin to be money&mdash;to be a thing ordinary people used to buy stuff because they cared about privacy, or because it was cheaper for merchants than accepting credit cards, or whatever&mdash;the wild rise in bitcoin’s value was a disaster.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">然而! 对于那些希望比特币成为钱 —— 成为普通人用来买东西的东西，因为他们关心隐私，或者因为它对商家来说比接受信用卡更便宜，或者其他什么 —— 比特币价值的疯狂上涨是一场灾难。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Take a relatively normal year like 2016, before bitcoin’s bananas rise in 2017.  That year, the exchange rate more than doubled, to $952 per bitcoin. If we lived in a world where bitcoin was really money&mdash;where we got paid in bitcoin, and got mortgages in bitcoin, and bought groceries in bitcoin&mdash;this rise in the value of bitcoin would have caused a deflation far worse than the one in the Great Depression. It would have suddenly taken twice as much work to pay off a student loan or a mortgage. It would have destroyed the economy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">拿 2016 年这样一个相对正常的年份来说，在 2017 年比特币的香蕉式上涨之前。 那一年，汇率增加了一倍多，达到每枚比特币 952 美元。如果我们生活在一个比特币真的是钱的世界里 —— 我们用比特币发工资，用比特币获得抵押贷款，用比特币买杂货 —— 比特币价值的上升会造成比大萧条时期更糟糕的通货紧缩。偿还学生贷款或抵押贷款会突然需要两倍的工作量。这将摧毁经济。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Or take 2018, when the value of bitcoin fell from around $13,000 per bitcoin to around $4,000. In a world where people used bitcoin as money, this would have meant prices tripled in a single year&mdash;an inflation rate far worse than anything the United States has seen since the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">或者以 2018 年为例，当时比特币的价值从每个比特币 13,000 美元左右跌至 4000 美元左右。在一个人们使用比特币作为货币的世界里，这将意味着价格在一年内翻了三倍 —— 通货膨胀率远远超过美国自革命战争以来所看到的任何东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Indeed, people don’t even usually speak of an “exchange rate” between bitcoins and dollars. Instead, they talk about the “price of bitcoin.” It’s also common to multiply the price of one bitcoin by the number of bitcoins in existence and call the result bitcoin’s “market cap.” Nobody talks about money this way.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">事实上，人们甚至通常不谈论比特币和美元之间的“汇率”。相反，他们谈论的是“比特币的价格”。将一个比特币的价格乘以现有的比特币数量，并将结果称为比特币的“市值”也很常见。没有人这样谈论金钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Supporters of bitcoin say the price rise is evidence bitcoin has become a “store of value.” The phrase describes one of the traditional attributes of money. But store of value means, more or less, a thing that holds a stable value over time. If $100 buys your family a week’s worth of groceries today, there is a very good chance it will buy approximately a week’s worth of groceries a year from now. The dollar is a good store of value (it tends to lose about 2 percent of its value every year).</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">比特币的支持者说，价格上涨证明了比特币已经成为一种“价值储存”。这个短语描述了货币的一个传统属性。但价值储存的意思是，或多或少，一个在一段时间内保持稳定价值的东西。如果今天 100 美元能买到你家一周的杂货，那么很有可能一年后它能买到大约一周的杂货。美元是一种很好的价值储存（它每年往往会损失约 2% 的价值）。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The amount of bitcoin that buys you a week’s worth of groceries today might buy you only a day’s groceries a year from now. Or it might buy you an entire grocery store. It is not, by any stretch, a good store of value.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">今天给你买一周杂货的比特币，一年后可能只给你买一天的杂货。或者它可能会给你买一整个杂货店。不管怎么说，它都不是一个好的价值存储。</p>

<p class="calibre9">What the people who say bitcoin is a store of value mean&mdash;or,  at least, a more plausible thing to say&mdash;is that bitcoin has become a speculative investment. Bitcoin is a thing people buy because they think they are going to be able to sell it for more in the future&mdash;though they recognize they might have to sell it for less. This is not, in general, a useful quality in money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">那些说比特币是价值储存的人的意思是 —— 或者，至少是一个比较合理的说法 —— 是比特币已经成为一种投机性投资。比特币是一种人们购买的东西，因为他们认为他们在未来能够以更高的价格出售它 —— 尽管他们承认他们可能不得不以更低的价格出售它。一般来说，这不是货币的一个有用的品质。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The history of money is largely the history of stuff becoming money without people really realizing it. Banknotes and then bank deposits started out as a record of a debt and sort of crept their way into being full-blown money. Shadow banking grew for decades before anybody thought to call it shadow banking. It was only in moments of crisis&mdash;the moment when the thing suddenly threatened to become not-money&mdash;that everyone looked around and said, well, I guess banknotes and bank deposits and money-market mutual funds are money now.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">货币的历史主要是东西变成货币的历史，而人们并没有真正意识到这一点。纸币和银行存款一开始是作为一种债务的记录，后来逐渐变成了正式的货币。影子银行发展了几十年，才有人想到要叫它影子银行。只有在危机时刻，当这个东西突然有可能变成非货币的时候，大家才会环顾四周，说，好吧，我想钞票和银行存款以及货币市场共同基金现在是货币了。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The history of electronic money is exactly the opposite. Someone&mdash;David Chaum, Satoshi Nakamoto&mdash;has a very clever technological breakthrough. Then they climb up to the mountaintop and proclaim to the world: “Here is a new kind of money!” And then it doesn’t really become money. Or at least it hasn’t yet.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">电子货币的历史正好相反。有人 —— 大卫·乔姆，中本聪 —— 有一个非常聪明的技术突破。然后他们爬上山顶，向世界宣布：“这里有一种新的货币！”然后，它并没有真正成为钱。或者至少它还没有。</p>

</h1>

<p class="noindent">Money is a choice, or a set of choices. But it doesn’t feel that way. It just feels like the way things are. Then someone has an insight. They say: We are doing money all wrong. Here’s a better way to do it.</p>


<p class="noindent">金钱是一种选择，或者说是一系列的选择。但它并不觉得是这样的。它只是感觉到事情就是这样的。然后，有人有了一个洞察力。他们说。我们对金钱的处理是错误的。这里有一个更好的方法来做。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Everybody else says: What are you talking about? What we have <em class="calibre4">now</em> is real money. What you’re talking about is just some crazy idea you made up!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">其他人都说。你在说什么呢？我们<strong class="calibre4">现在</strong>所拥有的才是真正的钱。你所说的只是你编造的一些疯狂的想法！</p>

<p class="calibre9">Usually, that’s the end of it. But once in a while, something happens&mdash;a financial crisis, or a major political shift, or some new technology, or some combination of all three of those. And then suddenly everybody starts listening to those fringy people with the strange ideas about money, and there’s something new: paper money backed by gold, or paper money backed by nothing, or numbers on a computer.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">通常情况下，谈话就结束了。但偶尔会发生一些事情，比如金融危机，或者重大的政治转变，或者一些新技术，或者这三者的组合。然后突然间，每个人都开始听从那些对货币有奇怪想法的人的意见，并且出现了一些新的东西：由黄金支持的纸币，或由任何东西支持的纸币，或计算机上的数字。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There are lots of smart people who think that the way we do money right now is ridiculous, and they’re confident they have a better idea for how to do things. Their ideas are useful&mdash;not only in and of themselves, but also as a reminder that there’s nothing  natural or inevitable about the way money works now. We know money will be very different in the future; we just don’t know what kind of different it will be. Here are three possibilities.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">有很多聪明人认为，我们现在处理金钱的方式是荒谬的，而且他们相信他们有更好的想法来做事。他们的想法是有用的，不仅其本身是有用的，而且还提醒我们，现在的货币运作方式没有任何自然或不可避免之处。我们知道货币在未来会有很大的不同；我们只是不知道会有什么样的不同。这里有三种可能性。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-324" class="sect1">A World Without Cash 一个没有现金的世界</h1>

<p class="noindent">Of all the ways that money might change, one is particularly easy to imagine: paper money might disappear. When you can use a debit card to buy a pack of gum, what’s even the point of paper money?</p>

<p class="noindent">在货币可能发生变化的所有方式中，有一种特别容易想象：纸币可能消失。当你可以用借记卡买一包口香糖时，纸币还有什么意义呢？</p>

<p class="calibre9">This has been happening for a long time. Sending mobile money via text message took off in Kenya in 2007. By 2020, a single Chinese mobile payments app, called Alipay, was used by roughly 1 billion people.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">这种情况已经发生了很久了。2007 年，通过短信发送移动资金的做法在肯尼亚兴起。到 2020 年，一个名为支付宝的中国移动支付应用程序被大约 10 亿人使用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But in much of the world, even as payment apps proliferate, something strange is happening. Year after year, the amount of paper money floating around keeps growing faster than the overall economy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但在世界大部分地区，即使在支付应用程序激增的情况下，一些奇怪的事情正在发生。年复一年，四处漂浮的纸币数量一直比整体经济增长得快。</p>

<p class="calibre9">By 2020, there was more than $5,000 in paper dollars for every man, woman, and child in the United States. (This doesn’t count cash in bank vaults; it’s just money out in circulation.) The numbers are similar for the eurozone and Japan.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">到 2020 年，美国的每个男人、女人和孩子都有超过 5,000 美元的纸币。(这还不算银行金库里的现金，只是流通中的钱。）欧元区和日本的数字也差不多。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Where is all that money? What are people doing with it? Nobody knows! It’s just pieces of paper out in the world! Some people are doubtless using hundred-dollar bills for very legal and very cool purposes. Some people in developing countries are keeping their life savings in dollar bills and euro notes to protect themselves against unreliable local currencies and shaky banks. Also, lots and lots of people are using lots and lots of cash to evade taxes and traffic in drugs, people, and stolen merchandise.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">所有这些钱都在哪里？人们在用它做什么？没人知道! 它只是世界上的一些纸片而已! 毫无疑问，有些人将百元大钞用于非常合法和非常酷的用途。发展中国家的一些人用美元和欧元纸币保存他们的毕生积蓄，以保护自己免受不可靠的当地货币和不稳定的银行的影响。此外，很多很多人正在使用大量的现金来逃税，贩运毒品、人口和被盗商品。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> One reason we can infer this is that almost all of the cash is in big bills. There are more hundred-dollar bills than one-dollar bills! There are more than forty hundred-dollar bills out in the world for every man, woman, and child in America. More than a trillion dollars in hundreds. The obvious fact is that hundreds (and other large bills) aren’t particularly useful for everyday life but are extraordinarily useful for committing crimes and for evading taxes (which is itself a crime).</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 我们可以推断的一个原因是，几乎所有的现金都是大钞。百元大钞比一元大钞更多！世界上每个男人和女人都有四十多张百元大钞。世界上每一个美国的男人、女人和孩子都有四十多张百元大钞在外面。超过一万亿美元的百元大钞。一个显而易见的事实是，百元钞票（和其他大额钞票）在日常生活中并不特别有用，但对于犯罪和逃税（这本身就是一种犯罪）来说却异常有用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cash is less and less necessary for daily (honest) life. Since cash makes crime easier, and it’s not going to disappear on its own, should governments get rid of cash to fight crime?</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">现金对日常（诚实）生活的必要性越来越小。既然现金使犯罪变得更容易，而且它不会自行消失，那么政府是否应该摆脱现金来打击犯罪？</p>

<p class="calibre9">The case against cash has been made most compellingly by Ken Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, now at Harvard. He argues not for getting rid of money entirely, but for getting rid of big bills and maybe ultimately replacing small bills with coins. The idea is to allow small cash transactions to continue but to make big cash transactions very inconvenient, which would effectively raise the cost of using cash to commit crimes.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">国际货币基金组织前首席经济学家、现任职于哈佛大学的肯·罗格夫(Ken Rogoff)对反对现金的理由做了最有力的阐述。他主张的不是完全摆脱货币，而是摆脱大额钞票，也许最终以硬币取代小额钞票。他的想法是允许小额现金交易继续进行，但让大额现金交易变得非常不方便，这将有效提高使用现金犯罪的成本。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Rogoff also points to be another, less intuitive benefit to getting rid of paper money: it could help countries recover faster from economic crises by making it easier for central banks to set negative interest rates.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">罗格夫还指出了摆脱纸币的另一个不太直观的好处：它可以帮助各国更快地从经济危机中恢复过来，使中央银行更容易设置负利率。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When you put money in the bank, the bank pays you interest, and your account grows a little every month. If interest rates were negative, your account would shrink a little every month. You would be paying the bank to hold your money. If this started happening, you and lots of other people might go to the bank and demand all your money in large bills and go stick it in a vault. Some central banks in Europe have set rates at a fraction of a percent below zero,  but they are afraid that if they go much lower, everybody would pull their cash out of the bank. Effectively, the floor for interest rates is zero minus the cost of storing cash in a vault.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当你把钱存入银行时，银行向你支付利息，你的账户每个月都会增长一点。如果利率为负数，你的账户就会每个月缩水一点。你将支付银行持有你的钱。如果这种情况开始发生，你和其他很多人可能会去银行，要求把你的钱都放在大钞里，然后把它塞进金库。欧洲的一些中央银行已经将利率设定为低于零的几分之一，但他们担心，如果利率更低，每个人都会把他们的现金从银行撤出。实际上，利率的下限是零减去将现金存放在保险库的成本。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Negative rates sound awful. But in a crisis, they might make almost everybody better off. In 2009, when US businesses were frantically cutting spending and firing hundreds of thousands of workers every month, it might have been useful if the Fed could have pushed interest rates well below zero. Negative rates would have given panicked businesses an incentive to hire and invest, rather than fire and save. But in 2009 the Fed could lower its key interest rate only to zero. And because that wasn’t really low enough, unemployment remained high, spending remained low, and the economy stagnated.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">负利率听起来很可怕。但在危机中，它们可能会让几乎所有人都过得更好。2009 年，当美国企业疯狂削减开支，每月解雇数十万工人时，如果美联储能将利率推至零以下，可能会有帮助。负利率会给惊慌失措的企业一个激励，让他们雇佣和投资，而不是解雇和储蓄。但在 2009 年，美联储只能将其关键利率降至零。由于这还不够低，失业率仍然很高，支出仍然很低，经济停滞。</p>

<p class="calibre9">There is one place in the developed world where cash is disappearing already: Sweden. When I first heard this, I assumed it was because everyone in Sweden is perfect and nobody commits crimes, so they don’t need cash; but in fact it’s sort of the opposite. There were a series of violent robberies in the mid-2000s, including one where a gang of thieves stole a helicopter, landed it on the roof of a cash depot, broke through a skylight with sledgehammers, blew their way into a vault, and flew away with 39 million kronor (more than $5 million). Police response was slowed by fake bombs the thieves had planted at the police helicopter station and metal spikes they’d put on the roads. A few of the thieves were caught and convicted, but almost none of the stolen money was ever recovered.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在发达国家中，有一个地方的现金已经在消失。瑞典。当我第一次听到这个消息时，我以为这是因为瑞典的每个人都很完美，没有人犯罪，所以他们不需要现金；但事实上，情况有点相反。2000 年代中期发生了一系列暴力抢劫案，其中包括一伙盗贼偷了一架直升机，把它降落在一个现金库的屋顶上，用大锤砸开天窗，通过爆破，他们进入金库，并带着 3900 万克朗（超过 500 万美元）飞走。盗贼在警察直升机站安放了假炸弹，并在道路上安放了金属钉，这使得警方反应迟缓。一些盗贼被抓获并被定罪，但几乎没有人找回被盗的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cash use started falling quickly after that. In 2010, 39 percent of Swedes said they’d used cash for their most recent purchase; that fell to 13 percent in 2018. Around half the bank branches in the  country stopped allowing cash withdrawals or cash deposits. The bank didn’t want your money. Instead, they encouraged people to use cards or a payment app called Swish. This provoked a polite backlash from some quarters. “We aren’t against the digital movement, but we think it’s going a bit too fast,” the president of the Swedish National Pensioners’ Association said.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">此后，现金的使用开始迅速下降。2010 年，39% 的瑞典人说他们最近一次购物时使用了现金；2018 年，这一比例下降到 13%。该国约有一半的银行分行停止允许提取现金或存入现金。银行并不想要你的钱。相反，他们鼓励人们使用银行卡或一个名为 Swish 的支付应用程序。这激起了某些方面的礼貌性反击。瑞典国家养老金协会主席说：“我们并不反对数字运动，但我们认为它发展得有点太快了。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">In 2019, the Swedes passed a law that required many bank branches to carry cash. (You now need a law to force banks to carry cash!) And the Riksbank&mdash;the central bank that four hundred years earlier had created the first state-authorized paper money in Europe&mdash;was trying to figure out how to issue e-krona, a digital currency that people could use through accounts at the central bank, or through rechargeable payment cards.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">2019 年，瑞典人通过了一项法律，要求许多银行分行携带现金。（你现在需要一部法律来强迫银行携带现金！）而瑞典中央银行（Riksbank） —— 这个四百年前创造了欧洲第一个国家授权的纸币的中央银行 —— 正试图找出如何发行 e-krona，一种人们可以通过中央银行的账户，或通过可充值支付卡使用的数字货币。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Maybe the most striking thing about the disappearance of cash is that we may not really care&mdash;sort of like what’s already happening with personal checks. If cash disappears, it will be harder to commit petty tax evasion, and the surveillance economy will intrude on us more than ever. The government will need to provide subsidized debit cards for people who don’t have bank accounts. But already, today, most money is not paper or coins. It’s money people have in their bank accounts. The core of money today isn’t pieces of paper. It’s bank deposits. It’s numbers stored on bank computers. That’s what money is, and has been, for decades.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">也许关于现金消失的最引人注目的事情是，我们可能并不真正关心 —— 有点像已经发生在个人支票上的事情。如果现金消失了，偷税漏税就更难了，监控经济将比以往任何时候都更多地侵扰我们。政府将需要为没有银行账户的人提供补贴的借记卡。但今天，大多数钱已经不是纸或硬币了。它是人们在银行账户中的钱。今天货币的核心不是纸片。它是银行存款。它是存储在银行电脑上的数字。这就是货币，而且几十年来一直如此。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cash could disappear, but our basic way of creating and managing money&mdash;with central banks, and commercial banks, and shadow banks&mdash;would remain unchanged. A much bigger change would come from getting rid of banks as we know them&mdash;an idea that has been backed by a surprising number of really smart people, for a long time.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">现金可以消失，但我们创造和管理货币的基本方式 —— 与中央银行、商业银行和影子银行 —— 将保持不变。更大的变化将来自于摆脱我们所知道的银行 —— 这个想法已经被数量惊人的真正聪明的人支持了很久。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-328" class="sect1"> A World Without Banks 一个没有银行的世界</h1>

<p class="noindent">Most of the money in the world is not just stored in private banks; it is created by private banks. When banks make loans, the proceeds are ultimately deposited in someone’s bank account as more money.</p>

<p class="noindent">世界上大多数的钱不只是储存在私人银行里，它是由私人银行创造的。当银行发放贷款时，收益最终被存入某人的银行账户，成为更多的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For nearly a hundred years, some of the smartest economists in every generation have said this is a horrible way to do money. It started in the 1930s when a group of the most famous economists in America (including our man Irving Fisher) wrote that banks’ ability to create and destroy money was “a chief loose screw in our present American money and banking system.” Their solution: the government should end banking as we know it.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">近一百年来，每一代人中最聪明的一些经济学家都说这是一种可怕的货币方式。这始于 20 世纪 30 年代，当时一群美国最有名的经济学家（包括我们的欧文·费舍尔）写道，银行创造和销毁货币的能力是“我们目前美国货币和银行系统中最松散的螺丝”。他们的解决方案是：政府应该终止我们所知的银行业务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">A government ban on banks sounds like a lefty dream. But lots of economists who love the free market and are wary of government intervention have argued for forcing private banks out of the business of creating money. Milton Friedman, whose crusade for free markets inspired Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, suggested ending banking as we know it. John Cochrane, a contemporary economist at the (conservative) Hoover Institution and (libertarian) Cato Institute, has called banks a “huge, crony-capitalist nightmare.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">政府对银行的禁令听起来像是一个左派的梦想。但很多热爱自由市场、对政府干预持谨慎态度的经济学家都主张迫使私人银行退出创造货币的业务。米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）对自由市场的讨伐激励了罗纳德·里根和玛格丽特·撒切尔，他建议结束我们所知的银行业务。胡佛研究所（保守派）和卡托研究所（自由派）的当代经济学家约翰·科克伦称银行是“巨大的、裙带资本主义的恶梦”。

<p class="calibre9">Banks are private companies that create and destroy a public resource&mdash;money. Because money is so essential, the government offers a massive but piecemeal safety net for the banks. Central banks are lenders of last resort. Government insurance programs back deposits. Regulators from multiple agencies try to keep banks safe, but sometimes fail to do so.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">银行是创造和破坏公共资源的私营公司 —— 货币。由于货币是如此重要，政府为银行提供了一个庞大但零散的安全网。中央银行是最后的贷款人。政府的保险计划支持存款。来自多个机构的监管者试图保持银行的安全，但有时却无法做到这一点。</p>

<p class="calibre9">When banks were bailed out after the financial crisis of 2008, people raged against “too big to fail” banks. The anger is justifiable, but the problem isn’t that banks are too big or that bankers  are too greedy; the problem is with the nature of banking. Banking is inherently prone to crises. And in any big financial crisis, the government has to choose between bailing out banks (whether they are big or small) or allowing failing banks to take down the whole economy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">当银行在 2008 年金融危机后被救助时，人们对“太大而不能倒”的银行大发雷霆。这种愤怒是有道理的，但问题不在于银行太大，也不在于银行家太贪婪；问题在于银行业的性质。银行业本身就容易发生危机。而在任何大的金融危机中，政府必须在拯救银行（无论它们是大是小）还是允许倒闭的银行拖垮整个经济之间做出选择。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cochrane and Friedman and Fisher step back, look at the system, and say, Wait. Why does it have to be like this at all? The root of the issue is that basic banks do these two, very different things.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">科克伦、弗里德曼和费希尔退后一步，看看这个系统，然后说，等等。为什么一定要这样呢？问题的根源在于，基本银行做的是这两件非常不同的事情。</p>

<ol class="calibre10">
<li value="1" class="calibre5">They hold our money and make it easier for us to get paid and make payments.</li>

<li value="1" class="calibre5 cn">他们持有我们的钱，使我们更容易得到报酬和付款。</li>

<li value="2" class="calibre5">They make loans.</li>

<li value="2" class="calibre5 cn">他们提供贷款。</li>

</ol>
<p class="calibre9">The dazzlingly simple argument from all of these great economists comes down to this: split those into separate businesses. Variations on this idea are usually called “100% reserve banking” or “full-reserve banking” (as opposed to the current, fractional-reserve banking system) or “narrow banking.” The details of the plans vary, but here’s a simple sketch.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">所有这些伟大的经济学家提出的令人眼花缭乱的简单论点归结为：把这些东西分成独立的业务。这个想法的变种通常被称为“100% 储备金银行”或“全储备金银行”（相对于目前的部分储备金银行系统而言）或“狭义银行”。这些计划的细节各不相同，但这里有一个简单的草图。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In this new world, one kind of business&mdash;call it a money warehouse&mdash;would hold our money. Our paychecks would get deposited there. We could pay our bills from our account there. We could get cash from the money warehouse’s ATMs. The money warehouse would store our money in an account at the Federal Reserve. We might pay a small fee to keep our money at the money warehouse. Fair enough. It’s a useful service!</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这个新世界里，有一种企业 —— 称之为货币仓库 —— 将持有我们的钱。我们的工资单将被存入那里。我们可以从那里的账户支付我们的账单。我们可以从货币仓库的自动取款机上获取现金。货币仓库会把我们的钱存放在美联储的一个账户里。我们可能会支付一点费用，把我们的钱存放在货币仓库。这很公平。这是一项有用的服务！</p>

<p class="calibre9">A different kind of business&mdash;call it a lender&mdash;would make loans. The money for those loans would come from investors’ money, and the investors would be prepared to lose that money if  the loans didn’t get paid back. There are already mutual funds that work like this. They take investors’ money and buy corporate bonds, which is a way of lending money to corporations. If the corporations don’t pay the money back, the investors take a loss. In a world without banks, you could have something like mutual funds make the loans that banks used to make.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">一种不同的企业 —— 称之为贷款人 —— 将提供贷款。这些贷款的资金将来自投资者的资金，如果贷款没有得到偿还，投资者将准备损失这些钱。已经有共同基金像这样运作。他们用投资者的钱购买公司债券，这是一种向公司借钱的方式。如果这些公司不还钱，投资者就会有损失。在一个没有银行的世界里，你可以让共同基金这样的东西来做银行曾经做过的贷款。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In this world, there is no such thing as a bank run. If everyone who had their money at the money warehouse suddenly asked for their money back, the warehouse would say: Okay, here you go. And everybody would get their money back.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在这个世界上，不存在银行挤兑这种情况。如果每个把钱放在货币仓库的人突然要求拿回他们的钱，仓库会说。好吧，给你。然后每个人都会拿回他们的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It’s hard to overstate how big of a change this would be. We would no longer need deposit insurance. We would no longer need a lender of last resort. We would no longer need thousands of pages of rules that are supposed to keep banks safe. Money warehouses and lenders could not start booms by creating money; even more important, they could not crash the economy by going bust and destroying money. Beautiful.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">很难夸大这将是一个多么大的变化。我们将不再需要存款保险。我们将不再需要最后的贷款人。我们将不再需要数千页的规则，这些规则被认为是为了保证银行的安全。货币仓库和贷款人不能通过创造货币来启动繁荣；更重要的是，他们不能通过破产和摧毁货币来崩溃经济。很好。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Think about it too hard, and two problems emerge. First, there will always be people who want to park their money somewhere and get paid some interest, people who are looking to borrow, and profit-seeking matchmakers. People will keep reinventing shadow banking. This is a big problem when shadow banking gets big, as it did in the early 2000s, but it is potentially solvable with the right set of rules. Potentially.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">想得太多了，就会出现两个问题。首先，总有一些人想把钱停在某个地方并获得一些利息，也有一些人想借钱，还有一些追求利润的媒人。人们会不断地重新发明影子银行。当影子银行变得很大时，这是一个大问题，就像它在 21 世纪初那样，但它有可能通过正确的规则得到解决。潜在的。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The second problem is weirder and more interesting. If all we did was ban banks from taking deposits and lending money, a vast amount of money would disappear. If we stop banks from creating money, where is all the money going to come from? The short answer is that central banks would have to create much more money. The power dynamic of money would shift from private banks to central banks.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">第二个问题更奇怪，也更有趣。如果我们所做的只是禁止银行吸收存款和放贷，大量的钱会消失。如果我们阻止银行创造货币，那么所有的钱将从哪里来？简短的答案是，中央银行将不得不创造更多的钱。货币的权力动态将从私人银行转移到中央银行。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> There was a moment, in the insanity of 1933, when a shift to the world of full-reserve banks could have happened. But instead, we wound up with the regime we still live with today&mdash;deposit insurance, the modern Federal Reserve, and banks that both take deposits and make loans. After the crisis of 2008, the head of the Bank of England said, “Of all the many ways of organizing banking, the worst is the one we have today.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在 1933 年的疯狂中，曾有一个时刻，向全储备银行的世界转变是可能的。但相反，我们最终建立了今天仍然存在的制度 —— 存款保险，现代美联储，以及既吸收存款又提供贷款的银行。在 2008 年的危机之后，英格兰银行的负责人说：“在所有的银行组织方式中，最糟糕的是我们今天的方式。”</p>

<p class="calibre9">But the response in Parliament in the UK, like the response in the US Congress, was to turn the dials on the system as it exists, not to fundamentally transform the system. The interests in favor of the status quo, these lawmakers found, are vast. It would take another big financial crisis to make full-reserve banking&mdash;or, for that matter, any radical change to the way we do money&mdash;a real political possibility.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，英国议会的反应，就像美国国会的反应一样，是在现有的系统上转动转盘，而不是从根本上改造这个系统。这些立法者发现，支持现状的利益是巨大的。要想让全额准备金银行业务成为真正的政治可能性，还需要另一场大的金融危机，或者说，对我们处理货币的方式进行任何根本性的改变。</p>

<h1 id="calibre_link-333" class="sect1">A World Where the Government Prints Money and Gives It to Anybody Who Wants a Job 一个政府印钞票并将其提供给任何想要工作的人的世界</h1>

<p class="noindent">In early 2019, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected congresswoman, started proposing massive new government projects&mdash;including a promise of a government job for any citizen who wanted one. People asked her how the government would pay for it. Maybe we’ll tax the rich, she said. Or maybe, she suggested, we can just spend the money and not worry about how to pay for it. She wasn’t being glib; she was drawing on a weird new way of thinking about money that had quietly been gathering steam for decades and was suddenly everywhere (or at least everywhere money nerds gathered).</p>

<p class="noindent">2019 年初，新当选的女议员亚历山大·奥卡西奥·科特兹(Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez)开始提出大规模的新政府项目 —— 包括承诺为任何想要工作的公民提供一份政府工作。人们问她，政府将如何支付这些费用。她说，也许我们会向富人征税。或者，她建议，我们可以只花钱，而不用担心如何支付。她并不是在夸夸其谈；她是在借鉴一种关于金钱的奇怪的新思维方式，这种思维方式已经悄悄地聚集了几十年，突然间到处都是（或者至少是金钱专家聚集的地方）。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It’s called Modern Monetary Theory, and while its intellectual  roots go back a century or so, we can start the story in the early 1990s when a hedge fund manager named Warren Mosler flew to Rome to meet with the Italian finance minister. Mosler had recently noticed that he could borrow money (Italian lira) from Italian banks and turn around and lend it to the Italian government for a higher interest rate. It was a free, guaranteed profit&mdash;as long as the Italian government didn’t default on its debts. So he’d gotten a meeting with the finance minister to ensure that wouldn’t happen.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">它被称为现代货币理论，虽然它的思想根源可以追溯到一个多世纪以前，但我们可以从二十世纪 90 年代初开始讲起，当时一位名叫沃伦·莫斯勒的对冲基金经理飞往罗马，与意大利财政部长会面。莫斯勒最近注意到，他可以从意大利银行借钱（意大利里拉），然后转身把钱借给意大利政府，获得更高的利息。这是一个免费的、有保证的利润 —— 只要意大利政府不拖欠其债务。因此，他得到了与财政部长的会面，以确保这不会发生。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Mosler had recently come to believe that most people fundamentally misunderstood how money worked. They were still stuck in a gold-standard mentality decades after the gold standard had disappeared. He pointed out that, unlike in the gold-standard world, a country that prints its own fiat currency, and borrows in that currency, never needs to default. It can always print more money to pay its debts.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">莫斯勒最近开始相信，大多数人从根本上误解了货币的运作。在金本位制消失几十年后，他们仍然停留在金本位制的思维模式中。他指出，与金本位制的世界不同，一个国家如果印刷自己的法定货币，并以这种货币进行借贷，永远不需要违约。它总是可以印刷更多的钱来偿还债务。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Printing more money can sometimes lead to inflation, Mosler knew. But it doesn’t <em class="calibre4">always</em> lead to inflation. He thought the essential thing for understanding an economy was not how much money the government was printing, but what was going on in the real world. Did everybody who wanted a job have a job? Were all the factories and offices operating at full capacity? Only if those things were true <em class="calibre4">and</em> the government kept putting more money into the economy and buying more goods and services would it start driving prices up and create inflation.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">印刷更多的钱有时会导致通货膨胀，莫斯勒知道。但它并不<strong class="calibre4">总是</strong>导致通货膨胀。他认为，理解一个经济体的关键不是政府印了多少钱，而是现实世界中发生了什么。每个想找工作的人都有工作吗？所有的工厂和办公室都在满负荷运转吗？只有当这些事情是真实的<strong class="calibre4">和</strong>政府不断向经济中投入更多的钱，购买更多的商品和服务时，它才会开始推动价格上涨，产生通货膨胀。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But what if the economy wasn’t operating at full capacity? What if there were a lot of people who wanted a job but couldn’t find one, and idle offices and factories? In that case, as the government put more money into the economy and started buying stuff, it would drive businesses to hire more workers. Prices wouldn’t start rising, Mosler argued, until the economy got to full employment.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，如果经济没有满负荷运转呢？如果有很多人想找工作却找不到，办公室和工厂闲置，那会怎样？在这种情况下，当政府把更多的钱投入经济并开始购买东西时，就会促使企业雇用更多的工人。莫斯勒认为，价格不会开始上涨，直到经济达到充分就业。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Unlike most foreign investors, Mosler wasn’t trying to convince the finance minister to cut spending. He wanted to convince the minister that Italy could just print money. The minister agreed. Mosler borrowed the lira from Italian banks, then turned around and loaned it to the Italian government. The Italian government paid the money back, with interest. Mosler made millions of dollars for his hedge fund.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 与大多数外国投资者不同，莫斯勒并没有试图说服财政部长削减开支。他想说服部长，意大利可以直接印钱。该部长同意了。莫斯勒从意大利银行借了里拉，然后转身把它借给了意大利政府。意大利政府把钱连本带利地还给了他。莫斯勒为他的对冲基金赚了数百万美元。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the United States at the time, Congress and the president were raising taxes to fight the budget deficit. Mosler, like a lot of rich people, didn’t like higher taxes. But added to this basic dislike, he now had a bigger theory of why they were unnecessary. Inflation was low; there were unemployed workers in America; rather than raising taxes, the government could simply spend more money.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">在当时的美国，国会和总统正在提高税收以对抗预算赤字。莫斯勒，像许多富人一样，不喜欢高税收。但是，除了这种基本的不喜欢，他现在有一个更大的理论，即为什么他们没有必要。通货膨胀率很低；美国有失业的工人；与其加税，政府不如花更多的钱。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The very idea that the government needs to tax citizens to spend money is backward, Mosler argued. This money that the government is collecting in taxes&mdash;where does it come from? What is the origin of a dollar? A dollar enters the world, Mosler said, when the US government buys something and the US Treasury puts dollars into the bank account of the seller. This is how dollars get out into the world in the first instance. When the government collects taxes, it is just taking back dollars it originally created to buy stuff.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">莫斯勒认为，政府需要向公民征税来花钱的想法本身就是落后的。政府征收的这些钱 —— 它从哪里来？一美元的来源是什么？莫斯勒说，当美国政府购买东西，美国财政部将美元存入卖方的银行账户时，美元就进入了这个世界。这就是美元最初进入世界的方式。当政府收税时，它只是拿回它最初创造的美元来买东西。</p>

<p class="calibre9">He decided he had to convince powerful people that his new view of the world was right and everybody else was wrong. Through his old boss, he got a meeting with Donald Rumsfeld, who had worked for multiple presidents. Mosler flew to Chicago and, bizarrely, met with Rumsfeld in a steam room. Rumsfeld sent Mosler to Art Laffer, an economist who is most famous for arguing for lower taxes. Mosler wound up paying a colleague of Laffer’s $25,000 to cowrite a paper called “Soft Currency Economics.”</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">他决定，他必须说服有权势的人，他对世界的新看法是正确的，其他人都是错误的。通过他的老上司，他得到了与唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德的会面，后者曾为多位总统工作。莫斯勒飞往芝加哥，奇怪的是，他在一间蒸汽房里与拉姆斯菲尔德会面。拉姆斯菲尔德让莫斯勒去见阿特·拉弗，这位经济学家因主张降低税率而最为著名。莫斯勒最终向拉弗的一位同事支付了 25,000 美元，让他撰写一篇名为《软货币经济学》的论文。</p>

<p class="calibre9">“In the midst of great abundance our leaders promote privation,”  the paper began. “We are told that we cannot afford to hire more teachers, while many teachers are unemployed. And we are told we cannot afford to give away school lunches, while surplus food goes to waste.” The essential message: stop worrying about deficits all the time. The government can print and spend as much money as it wants, as long as there are people who are looking for work and unused resources exist in the economy.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">“在巨大的富足中，我们的领导人提倡匮乏”，该文件开始说道。“我们被告知，我们雇不起更多的教师，而许多教师却在失业。我们被告知，我们无法承担赠送学校午餐的费用，而多余的食物却被浪费。”基本信息：不要再一直担心赤字了。只要有人在找工作，只要经济中存在未使用的资源，政府就可以随心所欲地印刷和花费钱财。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Almost nobody read the paper. Mosler spent decades in the wilderness (and by wilderness, I mean the Caribbean, where he lived, in part, to avoid paying taxes). He funded a few fringe economists who were working on similar ideas, and who came up with a name for this way of looking at the world: Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT for short.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">几乎没有人读过这份文件。莫斯勒在荒野中度过了几十年（我说的荒野是指加勒比海，他住在那里，部分是为了避税）。他资助了一些研究类似观点的边缘经济学家，他们为这种看待世界的方式起了一个名字，“现代货币理论”，或简称为 MMT。</p>

<p class="calibre9">In the mid-’90s, a young economist named Stephanie Kelton studied at one of the programs funded by Mosler. She was interested but skeptical. She wanted to understand how government spending really worked. Not the theory, but the thing itself. She spent months studying the arcane details&mdash;reading Fed manuals, talking to people whose job was to move money in and out of government accounts at the Treasury Department. Where does the money come from? Where does it go? Her conclusion: the government creates dollars&mdash;puts new money into circulation&mdash;by buying stuff. It takes money out of circulation by taxing or borrowing.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">90 年代中期，一位名叫斯蒂芬妮·凯尔顿的年轻经济学家在莫斯勒资助的一个项目中学习。她对此很感兴趣，但又持怀疑态度。她想了解政府开支的真正运作方式。不是理论，而是事情本身。她花了几个月的时间研究这些神秘的细节，阅读美联储的手册，与那些在财政部负责将钱存入和取出政府账户的人交谈。这些钱从哪里来？它去了哪里？她的结论是：政府通过购买东西创造美元 —— 将新的货币投入流通 —— 它通过征税或借贷将钱从流通中拿走。</p>

<p class="calibre9">For Kelton and her colleagues, the implications were huge. They shouted from the rooftops that we could worry about deficits much less, and much less often. With this abundance, they said, the government could do much more. Perhaps most important, they argued, the government could and should offer a job to any American who wanted one. If inflation starts to rise, the government can cool things off by raising taxes to take money out of the system.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">对于凯尔顿和她的同事来说，其意义是巨大的。他们在屋顶上大声疾呼，我们可以更少地担心赤字，也更少地担心赤字。他们说，有了这些财富，政府可以做得更多。他们认为，也许最重要的是，政府可以而且应该向任何想要工作的美国人提供一份工作。如果通货膨胀开始上升，政府可以通过增加税收来使事情降温，将钱从系统中取出。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> In 2015, Stephanie Kelton’s work caught the eye of Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign. Sanders didn’t seem that interested in the details of MMT. But he liked the idea of the government being able to spend lots of money on things like a jobs guarantee. Kelton became Sanders’s economic advisor and started telling reporters about MMT. The theory got another boost when Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives two years later, and a newly elected congresswoman drew on MMT to suggest that maybe the government could start doing lots more stuff without worrying about how to pay for it.</p>


<p class="calibre9 cn"> 2015 年，斯蒂芬妮·凯尔顿的工作引起了伯尼·桑德斯的总统竞选的注意。桑德斯似乎对 MMT 的细节并不那么感兴趣。但他喜欢政府能够在就业保障等方面花费大量资金的想法。凯尔顿成为桑德斯的经济顾问，开始向记者介绍 MMT。两年后，民主党赢得了众议院的多数席位，这一理论得到了另一次推动，一位新当选的女议员借鉴了 MMT，建议政府也许可以开始做更多的事情，而不必担心如何支付这些费用。</p>

<p class="calibre9">But no politician really seemed to go all the way with MMT. That would mean not only saying the government should spend a lot more money, it would mean saying that if too much spending does create inflation, Congress should raise taxes to pull money out of the system and cool things down.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">但是，似乎没有一个政治家真正走在 MMT 的前列。这不仅意味着政府应该花更多的钱，还意味着如果过多的支出确实造成了通货膨胀，国会应该增加税收，把钱从系统中抽出来，使事情降温。</p>

<p class="calibre9">Traditional economists have questioned many of the MMT arguments. Lots of people disagree with its fundamental tenets. But that last point&mdash;the idea that we should trust Congress to fight inflation&mdash;may be the hardest part to swallow. Not for any theoretical reason. More because, <em class="calibre4">really</em> ? Trust Congress to raise taxes when inflation starts rising? Come on.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">传统的经济学家对 MMT 的许多论点提出质疑。很多人都不同意它的基本信条。但最后一点 —— 我们应该相信国会来对抗通货膨胀的想法 —— 可能是最难接受的部分。不是因为任何理论上的原因。更多是因为，<strong class="calibre4">真的</strong>？当通货膨胀开始上升时，相信国会会增加税收？来吧。</p>

<p class="calibre9">The way we do money now is undemocratic. Politicians appoint central bankers to control a nation’s (or a continent’s) money. And then, to a large extent, the politicians leave the central bankers alone. If the central bankers want to create trillions of dollars and bail out shadow banks in a crisis, they can. If the central bankers want to jack up interest rates to fight inflation, they can&mdash;even if high rates mean lots of workers will lose their jobs. We have chosen to create this world. We have chosen to tie our own democratic hands and let central bankers do what they think is best.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">我们现在做货币的方式是不民主的。政治家们任命中央银行家来控制一个国家（或一个大陆）的货币。然后，在很大程度上，政治家们不去管中央银行家。如果中央银行家想创造数万亿美元并在危机中救助影子银行，他们可以。如果中央银行家想抬高利率来对抗通货膨胀，他们可以，即使高利率意味着许多工人将失去工作。我们选择了创造这个世界。我们选择束缚自己的民主之手，让中央银行家做他们认为最好的事情。</p>

<p class="calibre9"> Stephanie Kelton and the MMTers are saying that it doesn’t have to be this way. Money can be more democratic. We don’t have to throw people out of work to fight inflation. But to do that, we’d have to decide that we trust ourselves&mdash;that we trust our elected representatives&mdash;to control money itself.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn"> 凯尔顿和 MMT 的人说，不一定要这样。货币可以更加民主。我们不必为了对抗通货膨胀而让人们失去工作。但要做到这一点，我们必须决定，我们相信自己&mdash;我们相信我们选出的代表&mdash;能够控制货币本身。</p>

<p class="noindent">In the spring of 2020, as this book went to press, a pandemic was walloping economies around the world. More dramatically than ever before, central banks were following Walter Bagehot’s advice to lend freely into a panic. In the twenty-first century, that meant trillions of dollars and euros and yen loaned to banks, and shadow banks, and ordinary businesses.</p>

<p class="noindent">在 2020 年春天，当这本书出版时，一场大流行病正在冲击着世界各地的经济。与以往任何时候相比，中央银行都在遵循沃尔特·巴盖特（Walter Bagehot）的建议，在恐慌中自由放贷。在二十一世纪，这意味着向银行、影子银行和普通企业贷款数万亿美元、欧元和日元。</p>

<p class="calibre9">It was unclear whether the pandemic would cause a full-blown financial crisis, much less if it would cause permanent changes to the way money works. But some day&mdash;maybe next week, maybe in ten years&mdash;there will be another financial crisis. And another. Technology will change and governments will change. People’s beliefs about the balance between individuals and society, banks and governments, privacy and convenience, stability and growth, will all change. All of which is to say that money will change. The way we do money will look as strange to our great-great-grandchildren as a world where banks print their own paper money with pictures of Santa Claus.</p>

<p class="calibre9 cn">目前还不清楚这种大流行病是否会导致全面的金融危机，更不清楚它是否会对货币运作方式造成永久性的改变。但总有一天，也许是下周，也许是十年后，会有另一场金融危机发生。还有另一次。技术会改变，政府会改变。人们对个人与社会、银行与政府、隐私与便利、稳定与增长之间的平衡的信念都会改变。所有这些都是在说，货币将改变。在我们的曾曾孙子看来，我们做钱的方式会像银行自己印制带有圣诞老人图片的纸币的世界一样奇怪。</p>

<p class="noindent">Sloan Harris and Heather Karpas, my agents at ICM, told me to write a real book, and pushed me to make it good. At Hachette, Paul Whitlatch went out of his way to buy the book, Mollie Weisenfeld shepherded the manuscript along, and Lauren Marino gave a strong push at the end and made the book much better.</p>

<p class="calibre9">
<em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em> is not only where I learned about money and economics; it’s where I learned to tell a story. I owe a massive debt of gratitude to everyone I’ve worked with at NPR, but I have to single out one person in particular: David Kestenbaum. He was my mentor, my work husband through years of stories, and he remains my friend.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Bryant Urstdat helped come up with the title of this book. Keith Romer gave good notes on a messed-up draft. Alex Goldmark worked to make it easy for me to take time off from <em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em> to work on the book. The Brooklyn Public Library, New York Public Library, and Columbia University Libraries were essential.</p>

<p class="calibre9">My parents taught me how to think and showed me what it means to love books. My daughters are teaching me those lessons again. My wife, Alexandra Alter, read early drafts of this book and gave me guidance and wisdom about the book and everything else.</p>

<h1 class="appendix-title"> <a href="#calibre_link-14">Notes</a>
</h1>
<p class="noindent">A few books helped me think broadly about how to put together a history of money. These included <em class="calibre4">A History of Money</em> , by Glyn Davies; <em class="calibre4">The Ascent of Money</em> , by Niall Ferguson; <em class="calibre4">Money</em> , by John Kenneth Galbraith; and <em class="calibre4">Money Changes Everything</em> , by William Goetzmann. I originally encountered some of the material in this book as a reporter for <em class="calibre4">Planet Money</em>. In the process of working on the book, I reconfirmed and extended all of my previous reporting.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-341" class="sect1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Mademoiselle Zélie’s letter was printed as a footnote in <em class="calibre4">Traictie de la Première Invention des Monnoies de Nicole Orseme</em> , edited by M. L. Woloski. It was translated for me by Benoit Hochedez. The letter was made famous (among money nerds, at least) by Jevons. Details of the potlatch come from Davies.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The Caroline Humphrey quote on barter is from her article “Barter and Economic Disintegration,” published in the journal <em class="calibre4">Man</em>. David Graeber made much of the myth of barter in <em class="calibre4">Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>. Norms of gift giving and reciprocity in traditional cultures have been widely discussed, perhaps most famously in Marcel Mauss’s <em class="calibre4">The Gift</em>. The details about different types of proto-money in different cultures come from Paul Einzig’s <em class="calibre4">Primitive Money</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The idea that writing developed from clay tokens pressed into clay balls has been developed largely by the archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat and is described for a general audience in her book <em class="calibre4">How Writing Came About</em>. I spoke with Robert Englund, professor emeritus at UCLA, to understand Mesopotamian accounting and clay tablets. The “Abasaga” tablet is described in <em class="calibre4">Cuneiform Texts in the Metropolitan Museum of Art</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">
<em class="calibre4">Creators, Conquerors, and Citizens</em> , by Robin Waterfield, provided useful details on ancient Greek history and the rise of the poleis. The archaeologist Nicholas  Cahill, who directed the dig at the former Lydian capital, spoke to me about the Lydians’ invention of coins. David Schaps’s <em class="calibre4">The Invention of Coinage and the Monetization of Ancient Greece</em> was a revelation, illuminating how coins transformed life in Greece. I spoke with Schaps to better understand a few of the points in his book, which was also the source of the Aristotle quotes.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-343" class="sect1">Chapter 2</h1>
<p class="noindent3">The development of coins and paper money in Sichuan was described to me in an interview by the historian Richard von Glahn. His book <em class="calibre4">The Economic History of China</em> was also a source.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The details of Cai Lun’s invention of paper come from Mark Kurlansky’s book <em class="calibre4">Paper</em>. Modern scholars have pointed out that, as with most inventions, the invention of paper was probably not a single epiphany, and Cai likely improved upon work others were doing.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The counterfeit currency warning is from von Glahn’s paper “Re-examining the Authenticity of Song Paper Money Specimens,” published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal of Song-Yuan Studies</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The details of China’s economic revolution come from Mark Elvin’s book <em class="calibre4">The Pattern of the Chinese Past</em>. The restaurant quote comes from Nicholas Kiefer’s paper “Economics and the Origin of the Restaurant,” published in <em class="calibre4">Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The story of the Mongols in China comes from Morris Rossabi’s <em class="calibre4">Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times</em> , Jack Weatherford’s <em class="calibre4">Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World</em> , von Glahn’s <em class="calibre4">History</em> , and from conversations with von Glahn and Rossabi.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Kenneth Pomeranz’s book <em class="calibre4">The Great Divergence</em> was influential on why Europe became so much richer than China in the modern era. In <em class="calibre4">The Chinese Market Economy, 1000&ndash;1500</em> , William Guanglin Liu provides a detailed analysis of China’s economic boom and ultimate economic decline, and describes in detail the rulers’ shifting views of money and markets that led to both the rise and fall of the Chinese economy.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-344" class="sect1">Chapter 3</h1>
<p class="noindent3">The poor quality of the coins in seventeenth-century England is discussed, among other places, in Thomas Macaulay’s <em class="calibre4">History of England</em> , which is the  source of the “wrangling” quote. Conversations with economic historians Stephen Quinn and George Selgin helped me understand the emergence of goldsmith fractional-reserve banking. Quinn’s paper “Goldsmith-Banking: Mutual Acceptance and Interbanker Clearing in Restoration London,” published in <em class="calibre4">Explorations in Economic History</em> , and Selgin’s “Those Dishonest Goldsmiths,” from <em class="calibre4">Financial History Review</em> , were also helpful. Swedish copper money is described in <em class="calibre4">The Encyclopedia of Money</em> , by Larry Allen, and <em class="calibre4">Money and Power</em> , by Gunnar Wetterberg.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The details about early Barcelona bankers come from <em class="calibre4">Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles</em> , by Jesús Huerta de Soto. Davies was the source for much of the information about the bank run in England when King Charles decided to stop paying the debt. The quote where the treasurer of the navy worries about “notes which is now not money” comes from the British Treasury Minute Book for January 1672, which is available online, and is quoted in J. Keith Horsefield’s “The Beginnings of Paper Money in England,” published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal of European Economic History</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">If you want to read a biography of John Law (and who wouldn’t?), I recommend Janet Gleeson’s <em class="calibre4">Millionaire: The Philanderer, Gambler, and Duelist Who Invented Modern Finance</em>. It’s fun and readable and smart and is the source of several of the biographical details of Law’s life that run through chapters 3 through 7. <em class="calibre4">John Law: Economic Theorist and Policy-Maker</em> , by Antoin Murphy, was also a major source for these chapters and is especially strong on Law’s writing and thinking about money and economics. Law’s story is also discussed at length in Ferguson, Galbraith, and Davies.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-346" class="sect1">Chapter 4</h1>
<p class="noindent3">The history and math of the problem of the points is described in detail by Keith Devlin in his book <em class="calibre4">The Unfinished Game.</em></p>

<p class="noindent3">Ian Hacking’s <em class="calibre4">The Emergence of Probability</em> helped me think about the radical transformation in thought that came with the rise of probability and is the source of the knucklebone information. Peter Bernstein’s <em class="calibre4">Against the Gods</em> had useful narrative detail about Pascal and Halley.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Halley’s paper was called “An Estimate of the Degrees of the Mortality of Mankind; drawn from curious Tables of the Births and Funerals at the City of Breslaw; with an Attempt to ascertain the Price of Annuities upon Lives.”  It was published in the <em class="calibre4">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</em>. James Ciecka’s “Edmond Halley’s Life Table and Its Uses,” published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal of Legal Economics</em> , was a useful guide.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The figures from Wallace and Webster’s life insurance fund are from “Early Actuarial Work in Eighteenth-Century Scotland,” by J. B. Dow, published in the <em class="calibre4">Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries</em>. The Wallace and Webster story is well told by Ferguson.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-348" class="sect1">Chapter 5</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Matt Levine writes for Bloomberg. The quote about finance as time travel comes from his “Money Stuff” newsletter, which is great.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The most important source for this chapter was <em class="calibre4">The World’s First Stock Exchange</em> , by Lodewijk Petram. The book includes a lucid narrative of the VOC, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and the work of Isaac Le Maire. Also useful were “The Formative Years of the Modern Corporation: The Dutch East India Company VOC, 1602&ndash;1623,” from the <em class="calibre4">Journal of Economic History</em> , by Oscar Gelderblom, Abe de Jong, and Joost Jonker; and “Isaac Le Maire and the Share Trading of the Dutch East India Company,” by J. G. van Dillen, as translated by Asha Majithia and published in <em class="calibre4">Pioneers of Financial Economics</em> , Volume 1.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Joseph de la Vega, author of <em class="calibre4">Confusion of Confusions</em> , was born in Spain. His book was originally published in Spanish as <em class="calibre4">Confusion de Confusiones</em>.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-349" class="sect1">Chapter 6</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Details on Amsterdam’s public bank come mainly from “Early Public Banks,” a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago working paper by William Roberds and François R. Velde, and from my interview with Velde.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Law’s “Money and Trade Considered” is discussed at length in Murphy’s biography of Law. His wanderings through Europe and rise in France are described by Gleeson and Murphy. The <em class="calibre4">Memoirs</em> of Duc de Saint-Simon, Volume 3, translated by Lucy Norton, are a great source of details about the Duke of Orléans’s debauched style, as well as Law’s rise through Parisian society.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Details about the creation of the Bank of England come from <em class="calibre4">Till Time’s Last Sand: A History of the Bank of England, 1694&ndash;2013</em> , by David Kynaston. The  magazine that reported the Regent’s deposit in John Law’s bank was the <em class="calibre4">Gazette de la Régence</em> , as quoted in Gleeson.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-351" class="sect1">Chapter 7</h1>
<p class="noindent3">The key sources for this chapter are Gleeson; Murphy; “John Law’s System,” published by François Velde in the <em class="calibre4">American Economic Review</em> ; and my interview with Velde.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The quote from the Regent’s mother about tobacco is from Gleeson. The description of supplicants coming down Law’s chimney comes from Saint-Simon. The quote from Defoe is from <em class="calibre4">John Law and the Mississippi Scheme</em> , an anthology of Defoe’s writings on Law.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The quote from the clerk at the British embassy describing the mania comes from Murphy, as does the quote from the French government thanking Law.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The transportation of criminals to the Mississippi colony is described in <em class="calibre4">Louisiana and the Gulf South Frontier, 1500&ndash;1821</em> , by F. Todd Smith. Information on inflation comes from “Prices and Wages at Paris Under John Law’s System,” by Earl J. Hamilton, published in the <em class="calibre4">Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>. The Saint-Simon quote comes from his <em class="calibre4">Memoirs</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Gleeson and Murphy are the key sources for the details of John Law’s life after the collapse.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-352" class="sect1">Chapter 8</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Nordhaus’s paper on the history of light was called “Do Real-Output and Real-Wage Measures Capture Reality? The History of Lighting Suggests Not.” It was published in a collection called <em class="calibre4">The Economics of New Goods</em>. In the paper, he not only analyzed the history of light, he also concluded that economists had been underestimating the gains in lighting technology, and as a result had underestimated the extent to which people had become richer over time.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Many of the details about Nordhaus’s investigation come from a personal interview. Some of the figures presented in the chapter were calculated by Nordhaus at my request (similar figures are presented in Nordhaus’s paper, but in a more complicated way).</p>

<p class="noindent3">Details on ways people made artificial light, and on people locking themselves in their houses overnight, come from <em class="calibre4">Brilliant</em> , by Jane Brox. Information on  Thomas Edison comes from <em class="calibre4">Brilliant</em> and from <em class="calibre4">The Edison Papers</em> , hosted online by Rutgers University. The <em class="calibre4">New York Times</em> article about health inspectors and Edison’s smokestacks was quoted in <em class="calibre4">Brilliant</em> and was from an article published on January 17, 1911.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-354" class="sect1">Chapter 9</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Many of the narrative details about the Luddites come from <em class="calibre4">The Making of the English Working Class</em> , by E. P. Thompson. <em class="calibre4">Rebels Against the Future</em> , by Kirkpatrick Sale, was also a useful source.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Marc Andreessen published “Why Software Is Eating the World” as an op-ed in the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The story about Roper selling his invention for £5 comes from <em class="calibre4">The Strutts and the Arkwrights, 1758&ndash;1830</em> , by R. S. Fitton and Alfred P. Wadsworth.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Quotes from Luddite letters come from <em class="calibre4">Writings of the Luddites</em> , edited by Kevin Binfield. I also interviewed Binfield to get an overview of the era.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Data on workers’ wages in this era, how they were an incentive for mechanization, and how they stagnated after mechanization, come from Robert Allen’s <em class="calibre4">The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective</em> and Allen’s “Engels’ Pause: Technical Change, Capital Accumulation, and Inequality in the British Industrial Revolution,” from <em class="calibre4">Explorations in Economic History</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Eric Hobsbawm called the Luddite attacks “collective bargaining by riot.” The economic historian Joel Mokyr provided useful details about the Luddites in an interview.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-355" class="sect1">Chapter 10</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Hume’s <em class="calibre4">Political Discourses</em> was published in 1752. The chapter on trade is “Of the Balance of Trade.” <em class="calibre4">The Infidel and the Professor</em> , by Dennis C. Rasmussen, helped me understand Hume’s work and, especially, Hume’s influence on Adam Smith.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Britain’s unintentional creation of the gold standard is described in Davies. Galbraith is good on the rise of the free silver movement in the United States. Details on William Jennings Bryan come from <em class="calibre4">A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan</em> , by Michael Kazin. The rock critic Greil Marcus used the phrases “anxiety and success” and “terror and deliverance” in <em class="calibre4">Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3"> McKinley’s speech is described in “Playing to the Press in McKinley’s Front Porch Campaign,” by William Harpine, published in <em class="calibre4">Rhetoric Society Quarterly</em>. The full speech was reported in the <em class="calibre4">Indianapolis Journal</em> under the headline “Money is the Issue.”</p>

<p class="noindent3">The key sources on Irving Fisher are <em class="calibre4">My Father, Irving Fisher</em> , by Irving Norton Fisher, and <em class="calibre4">Irving Fisher: A Biography</em> , by Robert Loring Allen. More recently, Sylvia Nassar wrote extensively about Fisher in her excellent book <em class="calibre4">Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius</em>. I also relied on Fisher’s own writings, especially <em class="calibre4">The Money Illusion, Stabilizing the Dollar</em> , and <em class="calibre4">Stable Money.</em></p>

<p class="noindent3">Domestic box office figures come from Box Office Mojo. Inflation calculations were made with the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ CPI Inflation Calculator.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-357" class="sect1">Chapter 11</h1>
<p class="noindent3">Thomas Govan’s <em class="calibre4">Nicholas Biddle</em> is the standard biography of Biddle and the source for details on his early life. In describing Biddle’s work running the Bank of the United States, I relied largely on Jane Knodell’s <em class="calibre4">The Second Bank of the United States</em> and on an interview I did with Knodell. Richard Sylla, of NYU, called Biddle the “world’s first self-conscious central banker” in an interview with the Minneapolis Fed.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Details about Andrew Jackson’s life come from Arthur Schlesinger Jr.’s <em class="calibre4">The Age of Jackson</em> , Jon Meacham’s <em class="calibre4">American Lion</em> , and <em class="calibre4">Andrew Jackson</em> , by H. W. Brands. Taney’s complaints about Biddle are from Taney’s “Bank War Manuscript.”</p>

<p class="noindent3">Bray Hammond’s <em class="calibre4">Banks and Politics in America: From the Revolution to the Civil War</em> was a key source for the free banking era. The quote about coins that “flew about the country with the celerity of magic” is from a Michigan bank commissioners’ report from 1839 and is quoted in Galbraith.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The number of banknotes in circulation comes from “Our Abominable Currency System,” published in the <em class="calibre4">Chicago Tribune</em> on February 13, 1863. In an interview, Matthew Jaremski mentioned the Santa Claus note as a particularly delightful example of a banknote of the era. I found an example of a Santa Claus note in Thompson’s 1859 <em class="calibre4">Bank Note Descriptive List, Supplementary to Thompson’s Bank Note &amp; Commercial Reporter</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The case in which a court said the right to deal in money should be as free as the right to deal in wheat or cotton was <em class="calibre4">Warner v. Beers</em> , in 1840. The  quote about the traveler having to constantly change money is from <em class="calibre4">Letters of Lowndes</em>. One of the important early papers in rethinking the free banking era was “The Free Banking Era: A Reexamination,” by Hugh Rockoff, published in the <em class="calibre4">Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</em>. “Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Free Banking Episodes?” by Rockoff and Ignacio Briones, published in <em class="calibre4">Econ Journal Watch</em> , is a good overview of the literature. The quote from Bagehot is from his book <em class="calibre4">Lombard Street</em> , still an essential source on the function of central banks during crises.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Roger Lowenstein’s <em class="calibre4">America’s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve</em> is a comprehensive account of the creation of the Fed and the source for many of the details about the origins of the Fed.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The quote about people blaming the wily practices of Wall Street is from Paul Warburg’s <em class="calibre4">The Federal Reserve System: Its Origin and Growth</em>. Gary Gorton wrote that if Wall Street greed caused financial crises, we’d have a crisis every week.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The quote about meeting in secret on the train car came from Frank A. Vanderlip, president of the National City Bank, who described the experience in the <em class="calibre4">Saturday Evening Post</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The details of how the Fed emerged after the bankers came back from Jekyll Island come from Lowenstein.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-359" class="sect1">Chapter 12</h1>
<p class="noindent3">
<em class="calibre4">Lords of Finance</em> , by Liaquat Ahamed, is brilliant and insightful and more delightful than a book about central bankers and the Great Depression has any right to be. It is an essential source for this chapter.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The other essential source is <em class="calibre4">A Monetary History of the United States, 1867&ndash;1960</em> , by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, who described in great detail everything the Federal Reserve banks did during this period, and who changed the way economists understand the Great Depression.</p>

<p class="noindent3">“The self-fulfilling prophecy” was coined in an article of the same name, published in <em class="calibre4">The Antioch Review</em> by Robert K. Merton. The 2012 survey of economists’ views on the gold standard was conducted by the IGM Forum at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Hoover’s “forced off the gold standard… means chaos” quote comes from a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, on October 4, 1932.</p>

<p class="noindent3"> Arthur Schlesinger Jr.’s “pseudo-respectability” quote is from his book <em class="calibre4">The Coming of the New Deal, 1933&ndash;1935</em>. Warren’s trip on a little plane to see Roosevelt is described in <em class="calibre4">The Money Makers</em> , by Eric Rauchway. Details on the bartering that emerged as money disappeared come from Ahamed.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The Woodin quote is from <em class="calibre4">One Nation Under Gold</em> , by James Ledbetter. The Roosevelt quote is from the official transcript of his press conference on March 8, 1933.</p>

<p class="noindent3">A firsthand account of the “end of Western Civilization” scene, when Roosevelt told his advisors he was taking the United States off the gold standard, comes from Raymond Moley’s <em class="calibre4">After Seven Years</em>. The scene is also described in Rauchway. Irving Fisher’s letter to his wife is quoted in <em class="calibre4">My Father, Irving Fisher</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Data on recoveries in prices, employment, and incomes in 1933 come from the St. Louis Fed. A key work on how the gold standard caused a global depression, and how leaving the gold standard was essential to turning the economy around, is <em class="calibre4">Golden Fetters</em> , by Barry Eichengreen. “The Gold Standard and the Great Depression,” by Eichengreen and Peter Temin, published in <em class="calibre4">Contemporary European History</em> , is a useful analysis of how “the mentality of the gold standard” transformed an ordinary economic contraction into the Great Depression.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Roosevelt’s letter to a Harvard professor is quoted in Schlesinger.</p>

<div class="calibre13"></div><h1 id="calibre_link-361" class="sect1">Chapter 13</h1>
<p class="noindent3">The idea that a shadow bank run was at the heart of the financial crisis of 2008 was largely developed by Gary Gorton, a Yale economist (who also worked for AIG, which was bailed out during the crisis by the federal government). Gorton’s book <em class="calibre4">Misunderstanding Financial Crises</em> is a good overview.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The story of Bruce Bent’s early life, and his development of the money-market mutual fund, comes largely from an interview I conducted with Bent and his son, Bruce Bent II.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Some details of the early growth of the Reserve Fund come from the <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> obituary of Henry Brown, “Co-Inventor of Money-Market Account Helped Serve Small Investors’ Interest,” by Stephen Miller.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Figures on the growth of money-market funds and their role in buying commercial paper come from “The Road to Repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act,” by  Arthur Wilmarth, published in the <em class="calibre4">Wake Forest Journal of Business and Intellectual Property Law</em> , and “The Evolution of the U.S. Commercial Paper Market Since 1980,” by Mitchell A. Post, published in the <em class="calibre4">Federal Reserve Bulletin</em>. Citi’s invention of asset-backed commercial paper is described in <em class="calibre4">The Growth of Shadow Banking</em> , by Matthias Thiemann.</p>

<p class="noindent3">Bent’s 2001 “garbage” quote about commercial paper was cited by the 2008 <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> article “A Money-Fund Manager’s Fateful Shift,” by Steve Stecklow and Diya Gullapalli, which traced Bent’s move into commercial paper. The “prudent rather than plain” quote from Bent II is from the Nov. 6, 2000, <em class="calibre4">Wall Street Journal</em> article “Money-Market Funds Suit Many Investors, But Proud Creator Frets About Extra Risk,” by Bridget O’Brian.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The writings of Zoltan Pozsar are an excellent source on the rise of institutional pools of money. See, for example, his <em class="calibre4">Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report</em> “Shadow Banking,” coauthored with Tobias Adrian, Adam Ashcraft, and Hayley Boesky. Pozsar also talked me through his ideas in an interview.</p>

<p class="noindent3">McCulley coined the term “shadow banking” at the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole conference in 2007. He later described that moment in an April 2010 speech titled “After the Crisis: Planning a New Financial Structure Learning from the Bank of Dad,” the transcript of which is posted on PIMCO’s website.</p>

<p class="noindent3">The Ricks quote is from his book <em class="calibre4">The Money Problem: Rethinking Financial Regulation</em>. Ricks also spoke with me in an interview.</p>
